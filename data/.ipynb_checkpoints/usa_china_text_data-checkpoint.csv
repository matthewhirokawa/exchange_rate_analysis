120725,On the 9th Anniversary of the Philippines-China South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal Ruling,"Nine years ago, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention unanimously ruled China’s expansive South China Sea maritime claims have no basis in international law. This decision, legally binding on both the Philippines and China, was a significant milestone and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between parties in the South China Sea.

Since the 2016 ruling, China has ignored the decision, continuing to assert unlawful and expansive maritime claims and taking increasingly aggressive actions against its neighbors. Beijing’s expansive claims directly infringe on the sovereign rights and jurisdictions of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia, and undermine peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

The United States supports a free and open Indo-Pacific. We seek to preserve peace and stability, uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, maintain the free flow of trade, and oppose coercion to settle maritime disputes. The United States calls on China to abide by the 2016 arbitral ruling and to cease its dangerous and destabilizing conduct."
110725,Secretary of State Marco Rubio Remarks to the Press,"SECRETARY RUBIO: We had a great visit – great visits. This is an extraordinary forum. ASEAN is the primary way in which the United States engages in Southeast Asia diplomatically. The United States is a country that has deep ties in this region. We are a Pacific nation. We have U.S. citizens that live in the Pacific, obviously in Hawaii and in other territories. And we have strong relationships with many of our partner nation-states here in the region, and that includes, for example, we are the – the United States is the single largest source of foreign direct investment. So we’re very happy to have come here today. We were very warmly received, very positively received. We had very good meetings, some (inaudible) deliverables, and new action items we’ll be able to work on together in the years to come.

QUESTION: Sir, how was your meeting with Wang Yi? How was the progress on that end?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, it was a very productive meeting. It wasn’t a negotiation. It was a meeting. It was a positive meeting. And it’s important that the United States and China have productive meetings and regular engagement and communications. So we felt really good about it – very – thought it was very constructive, and hopefully we’ll be able to build on that to continue to bring stability to our relationship. I think it would benefit the world for that to —

QUESTION: Did you discuss –

QUESTION: And tariffs?

QUESTION: – a summit between President Xi and President Trump?

SECRETARY RUBIO: President Trump’s been invited to visit China. It’s a visit he wants to undertake, and so we’ll work on finding the right date for that, but I’m sure it’ll happen because the President – both presidents want it to happen.

QUESTION: Sir, can you discuss some of the deliverables that were committed to today and yesterday?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, a couple deliverables – obviously, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Malaysia on civil nuclear cooperation, which is very positive. We saw elevation in our relationship with a number of countries that will be formalized over the next few weeks as well. So these are very positive engagements. We had a couple of defense agreements or defense sales that we were able to announce to a couple of our partners during this visit as well. Those will become public soon enough. And so we thought that it was a very positive engagement. And we identified new areas of cooperation.

One of the things we’re very interested in is taking on these scams that are going on, that are preying on, not just Americans, but even people here in many of the countries represented at ASEAN. And we think that these cyber criminals that are operating out there as well that are very harmful and – to our country but to all the countries that are represented here. So, but we hope to have some real deliverables on that, and we look forward to there being a very positive and productive leaders meeting in October.

QUESTION: Sir, a question on tariffs. Are you afraid that the tariffs (inaudible) ASEAN will backfire against the U.S.?

SECRETARY RUBIO: No, I’m not concerned about that. That’s not going to happen, because these tariffs are being applied on a global scale. These are not aimed at one country or one region. It’s all around the world. And it’s very simple, okay? For 20 or 30 years, the United States has built up enormous trade deficits with multiple countries around the world, in every region – in Europe, Canada, Mexico, and in this region as well – and that had to be addressed. And so that’s what the President is doing.

Now, obviously, those tariffs that he’s announced will take affect on the 1st of August, because markets need certainty. But there is always the possibility that before August 1st, or at some point after August 1st, we will reach arrangements with individual countries that changes those numbers in a positive way, but that takes some time to work on. So, that could happen. But by and large, this is not aimed at any one country. This is globalized. This applies to virtually every country in the world, because the trade deficit the U.S. was running with too many countries was simply unsustainable. We had to address it. We had to address it.

QUESTION: Sir, you talked – you met bilateral with all member of ASEAN.

SECRETARY RUBIO: Almost all.

QUESTION: But – yeah, yeah. Okay.

SECRETARY RUBIO: We tried. Yeah. But we saw everybody, and it was a very, very positive engagement. We were very warmly received – a lot of appreciation for the U.S. role, a lot of deep partnerships. Today, by the way, is the 30th anniversary of the U.S. diplomatic relations with Vietnam; that’s something we intend to continue to commemorate with real actions in addition to high-level meetings. So we had a very positive – this was a very, very positive trip.

QUESTION: Sir, can you discuss about – can you say to us what were you discussing with Mr. Lavrov this morning?

SECRETARY RUBIO: With Mr. Lavrov this morning?

QUESTION: Yeah, yes, before the –

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I’m not going to tell you what I was discussing with him, but it’s not a – unrelated to what we discussed yesterday.

QUESTION: How about aside of tariff, with ASEAN did you (inaudible) with the ASEAN member?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Sure. I mean, there’s a lot of things we have in common. I mean, cyber security is one example of something that I think everyone represented here is very deeply committed to. If you think about the digital economy, which is going to be critical to all the growth that’s going to go on in the world – and most of the growth that’s going to go on in the world is going to happen right here, okay? It’s in Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia; two-thirds of global economic growth is going to happen here over the next 25 or 30 years, and much of that is going to be on digital platforms. Those platforms have to be secure. They have to be secure from cyber criminals. They have to be secure from nation-state actors that may seek to undermine it. So that was a recurring theme in all of our engagements, and everyone is very enthusiastic to work together on these things.

Okay. Thank you. Thank you."
110725,Secretary of State Marco Rubio Remarks to the Traveling Press,"SECRETARY RUBIO:  You guys don’t look nearly as excited to see me as the foreign press briefing.  (Laughter.)  I’m going to spend more time with them.  Which way am I facing, this way?  It’s been – this has been really good.  I mean, we’ve had really great interactions, very positive – everyone’s been very positive and enthusiastic.  Obviously, the issue of trade comes up.  But as I remind everybody, there’s no country in the world that I can meet with right now where the issue of trade and tariffs wouldn’t come up, because this is a global action.

So our negotiators, the baseline will take effect the 1st of August, but obviously, as the President’s made clear, there are opportunities for adjustments based on arrangements that could be made between now and then.  But beyond that, it’s been very positive; all of our engagements here have been very positive.  We’ve been very warmly received, and everyone’s excited we’re here and excited about the opportunities to work together on a number of things.  We’ll have even a few more announcements to make about some elevation of strategic partnerships.  Obviously the Memorandum of Understanding we signed yesterday was very positive with the host country.  They did a great job hosting this, by the way.  This has been a great forum to be able to interact with a lot of different countries, and hopefully to take back some potential decisions that can be made that further strengthen our commitment to this part of the world.

As I pointed out today on two occasions during our interventions and opportunity to speak, the United States is a Pacific nation – not just the mainland of the United States that faces the Pacific, but we have American citizens, and one of our 50 states.  We have – the United States is the number one source of foreign direct investment in Southeast Asia.  We’re not abandoning any of that nor are we abandoning these strong bilateral ties that we have with many of these countries, some of which go back decades and decades.  In fact, today is the 30th anniversary of U.S. diplomatic relations with Vietnam, and think about how far that relationship has come.  We had a very positive meeting today, and with the Vietnamese, as an example, and we’re looking forward to building on – continue to build on that relationship, which is both deeply symbolic given how far our two countries have come, but also we have very exciting opportunities we’re going to be able to work together with them on, and we’re excited to be able to do that. 

So it’s been a great trip, it’s been a great visit.  It’s exceeded all of our expectations. 

QUESTION:  How was —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, how does —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, you met the Chinese – your Chinese counterpart earlier today.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I did.

QUESTION:  The President said just a couple of days ago that he enjoys good relations with China and the Chinese president.  At your meeting, is that the sense you get – that you have good relations with China?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It was a very constructive meeting.  Obviously, look, we’re two big, powerful countries, and there are always going to be issues that we disagree on.  I think there are some areas of potential cooperation.  I thought it was a very constructive, positive meeting, and a lot of work to do.  He’s absolutely right that the President has a very good relationship with President Xi.  It tracks back to his first term.  And obviously there are some issues we’re going to have to work through, and that’s to be expected with countries of our size and scope and influence in the world – two global powers such as the United States and China.  But I thought it was a very constructive and positive meeting and gave us some things we can work on together.

QUESTION:  Do you think they’re going to —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, what was your message to the foreign minister in the meeting?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Which foreign minister?   I’ve been meeting the foreign minister —

QUESTION:  Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh.  Well, look, it’s very constructive.  I think as I said, the President has a very positive working relationship with President Xi, and obviously the relationship I have with the foreign minister should reflect that.  So we acknowledged there are some issues that are going to be – we have to work through, not just beyond trade but others, but I thought it was a very constructive and positive meeting and gave us a lot to work on.  So that was our message, was the opportunity here to achieve some strategic stability and identify areas where we can cooperate together on and build better communications and working trust.

QUESTION:  What are the odds of a meeting —

QUESTION:  What are some areas of cooperation?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What? 

QUESTION:  What are some of those areas of cooperation?  The administration hasn’t spelled those out yet, so —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’re going to work through those.  We’re not – we don’t – I don’t have any announcement for you right now.  But it was a very constructive meeting.  I think we left it feeling as though there are some areas we’re going to be able to work together on.  And obviously, as we work through those and we do that in conjunction with the Chinese side, we’ll make public announcements.  The last interaction of our trade representatives was quite positive, and we can build on that and other areas of potential cooperation.

Yeah.

QUESTION:  What are the odds for a meeting or the outlook for a meeting?  We know President Trump has expressed interest in a meeting with President Xi this year, and President Xi has reciprocated with an invitation to China for the President and First Lady.  What’s the outlook or what are the odds of a meeting happening this year after this – after your initial —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, no, the odds are high.  I think both sides want to see it happen.  Obviously we have to build the right atmosphere and the right deliverables so that a visit isn’t just a visit, but it actually has some takeaways from it that are concrete.  But there’s a strong desire on both sides to do it.  The President wants to do it.  The Chinese side wants to see it happen.  President Xi has said that publicly.  So I think the odds are high.  I don’t have a date for  you, but I think it’s coming.  It’ll happen.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, what do you say to those who make the argument that the U.S. tariffs or the threat of those tariffs in the region actually creates an opening for China to be seen as the stable economic partner here?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I don’t agree with that assessment.  I mean, look, at the end of the day the United States has built these tremendous trade imbalances over the last 30 or 40 years.  It’s unfair to America and American workers and American – in addition to threaten our industrial capacity.  Trade needed to be revisited.  The President campaigned on that, and that’s what he’s doing, and he’s resetting it on a global scale. 

At the end of the day, look, I think countries are going to trade with multiple countries.  We don’t view this as an opening for anyone.  We don’t view it that way.  We view it as an opportunity to reset global trade in a way that’s fair for Americans after two or three decades of unfairness.  If you look at some of these trade deficits, they’re massive.  They’re massive.  That has to be addressed, and that’s not sustainable at its current – the current direction that it had gone.  This should have been done a long time ago.  President Trump’s finally done it.  And I think countries understand that.

This was different.  If this was us targeting 10 countries or five countries, then I would understand why countries would be upset.  But the truth of the matter is we’re resetting tariff levels with virtually every country in the world.  And so I understand – if you had a deal where you were running these huge trade deficits with the United States and exporting a lot to the U.S. and built your economy around exports, but had very little import or very little economic activity coming in from the United States, I understand why you don’t want that to change.  But I think most mature leaders – and everybody here is a mature leader – understands that that’s not a sustainable dynamic.  It was one that had to be changed, and that’s what the President’s doing.  So we’re going to be okay. 

QUESTION:  And in discussing trade with these counterparts in the region, did you open the aperture at all and also tell them that this is an opportunity for them to bring into the conversation or the negotiation other elements of the U.S. relationship, whether it be security elements, broader than trade?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that we want to expand on all the other issues, but I think we need to bifurcate the two.  Primarily the trade conversations have been about trade, and that’s how the President’s treated it.  Now, that doesn’t mean that there – the bulk of our meetings here were not about trade.  I’m not the trade negotiator for the United States.  We certainly appreciate the role that trade plays in our bilateral relationships with individual countries.  But the bulk of our talks here have been about all the other things that we cooperate on, whether it’s civil nuclear cooperation, whether it’s respecting international law when it comes to air rights and maritime rights and freedom of navigation and things of this nature, and other opportunities to work together.

So what’s been the bulk of our conversations and it’s been very positively received. 

QUESTION:  To follow up on that, Mr. Secretary, Japan’s prime minister said his country needs to wean itself from U.S. dependence in key areas such as security, as Tokyo faces the prospect of tariffs.  Did you discuss that in your meeting with the Japanese?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, we haven’t.  But at the end of the day, look, I don’t think that that’s a negative comment per se.  We obviously have very strong commitments and an alliance with Japan.  We continue to cooperate very closely with them.  As I speak to you now, there are active exercises going on between the United States and Japan.  So our relationship with them will continue to exist.  The idea that somehow Japan would be able to develop domestic – their own capabilities for mutual self-defense is not – not only is not something that we find offensive, it’s something we’d be supportive of, obviously within the confines of their constitutional system.  But they have some limitations on what they can do.  But the idea that Japan’s military would become more capable is not something we would be offended by; it’s something we would actually be encouraged by.

QUESTION:  So can you talk – you talked about points of possible cooperation with the Chinese.  But on the points, which are well known, of contention, did you get a sense that there was a willingness — 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.

QUESTION:  — of the Chinese to move, or are they just —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I wouldn’t – look, today’s meeting with our Chinese counterparts was not a negotiation on any of these matters.  It is the first time that I met my counterpart in person, who, by the way, happens to also be the national security advisor, so he’s also – he’s not the archivist, though.  (Laughter.)  But I suggested that perhaps he ask for that title and that way we’d be equal.  But —

QUESTION:  That’s a hell of a – that’s a lot bigger job than archivist in the U.S.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, there they have 5,000 years of archives too, so – (laughter) – but I would say that it was a very positive relation, a very positive interaction, and constructive is the most important part.  At the end of the day, no matter what, the United States and China have to have relations.  We have to have communication.  We have to be able to interact with one another.  And it’s just impossible for the foreign ministers of our respective countries to not engage in conversation. 

So I’m glad we had that meeting today.  There’s a lot of work to be done.  No one’s saying it’s easy, but we do have some opportunities on some things we might be able to work on to begin to build some momentum in our relationship.  I thought it was a very good meeting.  I really felt encouraged by it.  But look, there’s work to be done. 

QUESTION:  Secretary, if I can ask a follow-up question.  You mentioned that you see high odds of a meeting between the presidents of the U.S. and China.  There is a big Chinese military parade happening; it’s scheduled for September 3rd.  Did the Chinese foreign minister extend an invitation to that?  Was that discussed as a potential opportunity?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, we didn’t discuss any specific date in mind in that regard.  But the reason why I tell you there’s a high probability they’re going to meet is that they both want to meet, and my – I don’t know President Xi but I know President Trump, and I can tell you that he’s committed to having that meeting happen.  So the reason why I think there’s high odds of it happening is they both want it to happen. 

So I’m sure we’ll work on a date and find a mutually acceptable date for both sides, and I’m pretty confident.  We want it to be a good meeting and we’re going to work hard between now and whatever date that is to make sure that when that visit does happen, it’s as productive as possible. 

QUESTION:  We saw you today seek out the Russian foreign minister in the larger gathering.  Why did you go up and talk to him?  What did you guys discuss?  Did you give him a response from President Trump to the conversation you had yesterday? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, it was just a follow-up on an unrelated item to our conversation yesterday, and I’ll leave it at that. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, many Japanese people are concerning about the U.S. policy, which is demanding drastically increased defense spending.  Do you have something to comment?  How do you think of this? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I wouldn’t characterize it as a demand.  I mean, we’ve encouraged them to invest in certain capabilities.  It’s less to do with the amount of money and more to do about certain things they can do.  At the end of the day we are in an agreement with Japan on collective self-defense, on the ability to come to each other’s aid in a time of conflict or in a time of danger, and there are certain capacities that we think they have high capability.  We understand there are dynamics that – constitutional and legal that limit their ability to invest in certain things versus other things, and – but we have a very close relationship with Japan, very close. 

You may not know this – it’s an inside joke that’s now an outside joke, and I’ll share it with you, and that is that I have – I believe I have met with the foreign minister of Japan more than any other foreign minister on the planet in my five and a half months in office.  I think we’re up to, like, nine or 10 meetings.  We interact, and how we joke with each other is that we see each other more than we see our respective spouses.  And so it’s a very close relationship, a very historic relationship, and one that’s going to continue.

So again, I think anyone who’s looking for, like, drama or division there is – shouldn’t be doing it because the truth of the matter is our relationship with Japan is very solid, and obviously we’re both open, democratic governments.  So when there are some differences of opinion, it’s going to be public, not private – but I don’t see that as a negative.  We have a very strong and very good relationship with Japan, and that’s not going to change. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary – Mr. Secretary, in your conversation with Foreign Minister Wang, did the subject of Taiwan come up too, and in particular the recent military drills being held by the Taiwanese? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No issue about drills.  I think the Chinese position on Taiwan has been expressed.  I don’t think it’s a mystery to anyone in terms of where they stand on it.  And our position has also been expressed pretty openly.  So it was not – as I said, our meeting today was not a negotiation or a back-and-forth on items.  It was more about establishing a constructive baseline where we can continue to talk on multiple fronts, including trade but beyond trade.

QUESTION:  Secretary, if I can ask a question about your meeting with Vietnam, a country with one of the largest trade surpluses with the U.S.  We’ve heard that there was maybe some misunderstanding on – about the agreement announced last week for a 20 percent tariff, that the Vietnamese weren’t confident that that was fully agreed to, that perhaps they were looking for a 10 to 15 percent tariff.  Was that an issue that they raised, trying to lower their tariff level?  Was that – the tariff – an issue that they raised during the bilateral meeting today?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the issue of trade was raised.  We don’t – I’m not – I’m not the negotiator on trade —

QUESTION:  Sure.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — and neither is the foreign minister.  And so we weren’t here to negotiate a trade deal.  And I’ll refer you to our trade negotiators as far as the status of that.  Clearly, Vietnam feels that if they enter into an agreement with the United States, they want to have a tariff rate that’s at least as good as if not better than other countries that don’t have a trade agreement with us.  But I’ll leave – you’ll have to – I have to refer you to our negotiators because I just don’t know what the status of those negotiations are at this point.

QUESTION:  But just to – on that, the President did announce that there was an agreement reached with Vietnam, and yet Vietnam is saying that they never reached that agreement.  So they must have raised this issue with you today. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  I mean, that – neither that issue – it just wasn’t a trade meeting.  We didn’t – I’m not saying it’s not a relevant issue, it’s just not what the purpose of our meeting was about today.  We talked about a lot of other issues.  But perhaps the reason why it wasn’t raised is because I’m not the trade negotiator and these are not trade meetings. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, can I follow up on your meeting with Lavrov yesterday?  Have you had a chance to speak to the President about the ideas that were discussed in that meeting?  And what did you discuss with the foreign minister this morning? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Which one?  Lavrov?

QUESTION:  Lavrov, when you spoke to him on —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I went to talk to him about another topic.  It’s not big or mysterious, it’s just another topic.  So it’s – and I’m not going to – we’ll leave it at that.  And as far as – I did speak to the President last night, and – but I have no news to report to you on it right now.  But like I said, I thought yesterday’s meeting – I’m not – I don’t want to oversell it, okay, but it was constructive and there was some things that perhaps we can build on.  Maybe not.  I don’t know.  We’ll find out.  But there are some things that we will potentially explore, and I relayed that to the President and our team here last night.

QUESTION:  The President says that there’s going to be an announcement coming relevant or relating to Russia on Monday. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Mm-hmm.

QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about what his thinking is, based on your conversation last night, where things currently stand?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  No.  (Laughter.)  That’s what Monday will be about. 

QUESTION:  Can I follow up on —

QUESTION:  What about he did say that there’s a new agreement between the U.S. and NATO to get new U.S. weaponry through NATO to Ukraine, and NATO is going to fully pay for that, according to the President?  Can you explain to us exactly, number one, how that’s going to work and when those weapons, as part of this agreement, will actually get to Ukraine? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think what you’re referring to is something that Ukraine has already offered, and so has Europe, and that is to buy weapons from the United States and then provide them to Ukraine.  At the end of the day, some of the systems that Ukraine requires are systems that Europe doesn’t make.  They would have to purchase them from the United States. 

In addition to that, I would point to the fact that a number of the defensive weapons that Ukraine seeks are in – our Allies in NATO have them.  So as an example, Germany, I believe, has 13 or 14 Patriot batteries.  Other countries do as well, some others, and some have placed orders for that.  And so we continue to encourage our NATO Allies to provide those weapons, those systems, those defensive systems that Ukraine seeks – that they should provide those weapons to Ukraine since they have them in their stocks, and then we can enter into financial agreements with us where they can purchase the replacements. 

QUESTION:  So these are existing systems?  This is nothing new? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It can be both.  I mean, but at the end of the day, I mean, it’s a lot faster to move something, for example, from Germany to Ukraine than it is to order it from a factory and get it there.  So there are a couple different ways to approach it, but the key is that there are existing capacities within existing U.S. systems within Europe right now that can be transferred to Ukraine, and then the Europeans could purchase the replacements from the United States.  That’s one aspect of what I think the President was referring to yesterday. 

QUESTION:  Just to follow up on the Taiwan issue —

QUESTION:  And that’s why you gave —

QUESTION:  — did Foreign Minister Wang warn you against welcoming President Lai at – through – in a transit visa through the U.S.?  Did he – transit visit through the U.S., did he mention anything about that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, there was not – this was not a warning type meeting. 

QUESTION:  All right.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I mean, obviously we understand their viewpoints on Taiwan.  They’re well stated.  They’ve been stated for many years.  And – but this was not a meeting where any – each – either side warned each other about anything.  This was very constructive and productive, and I hope that that’s how they reflect it as well, because I thought it was a very positive meeting. 

QUESTION:  Any surprises over the last two days? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Surprises? 

QUESTION:  Yeah. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, I don’t think so.  We were very warmly received.  I tell you, I mean, the reception’s been great.

QUESTION:  And that was a surprise?  (Laughter.)

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, I’m just saying that it was a very friendly environment, and I think the reiteration to the point we made, and that is, look, I read these things about how the U.S. is not focused on the Indo-Pacific.  But it’s funny – everywhere I travel in the world, the headline is:  The U.S. is not paying enough attention, whether it’s the Western Hemisphere or NATO or even in the Middle East.  I think sometimes there’s a media dynamic that covers certain parts of the world more than others, but the relationships we have here have existed for a long time – a long time.  When you talk about 6,000 American companies that are directly invested in the economies of Southeast Asia, we’re not walking away from that.  We’re not walking away from that; we’re not walking away from our defense ties that we have in the region; we’re not walking away from the strong economic ties we have in the region.  On the contrary, we want to build on it. 

Just yesterday we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Malaysia on civil nuclear cooperation.  The – I believe as early – either last night or early this morning, our arrangement with – on another civil nuclear program with Thailand came into effect.  So we have a lot of positive things going on and we’re going to continue to build on those.  We’re excited about them and we’re not going to walk away from them.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, while you were in Malaysia, the Trump Administration announced – yeah – a new nomination for – to be ambassador of Malaysia.  Nick Adams, he’s sort of well known on X as a sort of social media personality and does lots of other things.  I was wondering what you could say about this nomination, why Mr. Adams was the right person for this pretty important position in the Indo-Pacific. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, the President makes those nominations.  I support the nomination.  He went through our process of the Presidential Personnel Office, and we look forward to the Senate confirming him so he can get here and be a part of our team. 

QUESTION:  Can I ask a step-back question on trade strategy?  You’ve talked many times now about how decades of trade policy have led to the deindustrialization of the U.S.  And so obviously you and other aides are trying to bring manufacturing or other industrial processes back to the U.S., but you haven’t really given us a vision of what exactly that entails.  I mean, what kinds of jobs are supposed to be coming back to the U.S.?  Howard Lutnick talked about people screwing in tiny things into iPhones, which people mocked after he said that line.  But so what about you?  Like, what vision of industrialization do you see that’s —  

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, there’s certain capacities countries have to be able to have.  For example – I’m just using these as examples – the ability to build a ship.  Right now we go around the world and people say, well, we bought 200 Boeing jets.  Well, Boeing has to be able to make them.  And frankly, we have huge backlogs on that.  So you talk about pharmaceuticals as an example.  Talk about national security – we’ve lost our ability to make pharmaceuticals in the United States and become heavily dependent on the foreign supply chain of the active ingredients that are necessary for pharmaceuticals. 

So I could go on and on, but, I mean, the capability of making things has a national security component to it, not just a jobs component to it.  They’re both important.  So I would look to those as examples of things that the U.S., because of certain decisions that were made by previous policymakers, we’ve seen some of these core industrial capabilities that are necessary not just for economic stability but for national security, leave the United States. 

I would also argue that in addition to our domestic manufacturing capability, I think we and others should be deeply concerned about certain supply chain vulnerabilities and overreliance on one part of the world versus anywhere else.  I don’t think it’s healthy for the United States or for the global economy to be so heavily dependent, as an example, on China or any other country for that matter, where all of the industrial or manufacturing capacity or supplies in the supply chain of a key element is all derived in one place.  So I’m sure you’ve seen the announcement yesterday where the Department of Defense has entered – has taken an equity stake in a company that will be able to process rare earths.  One thing is to have access to raw material; the other thing is to be able to process that raw material into something that’s usable for everything from high technology to anything that has a motor in it.

So I think we at a minimum have to diversify supply chains and secure them.  Some of that will be domestic; others will be in allied nation-states.  But these are the core components of the kinds of things we need to be focused on.  And the – it’s not just the deindustrialization of America.  It’s the loss of these key components and the concentration of those in one or two countries around the world that leave not just us but many countries vulnerable.  That’s just not a sustainable or acceptable situation to find ourselves in.

110725,Secretary Rubio’s Meeting with China’s Director of the Office of the CCP Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi,"The below is attributable to Spokesperson Tammy Bruce: 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with China’s Director of the Office of the CCP Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.  Secretary Rubio emphasized the importance of keeping channels of communication open. The discussion was constructive and pragmatic. They agreed to explore areas of potential cooperation, while seeking to manage differences.  The Secretary emphasized the need for continued discussion on a range of bilateral issues.  The Secretary also raised other issues of regional and global importance. "
080725,"Department Press Briefing – July 8, 2025","QUESTION: On – there was this press conference today. The Secretary of Defense and Agriculture were talking about the threat that the Chinese Government poses here in the United States with the strategic acquisition of farmland that’s near military bases. What is the State Department prepared to do to hedge against those kinds of intrusions?

MS BRUCE: Well, the – it’s an interagency kind of decision, and discussions that go on, also negotiations, the nature of a full, whole-of-government dynamic. When you’re dealing with agriculture, you’re dealing with homeland security certainly, and their – the equities that the State Department might hold, I won’t discuss what our actions would be or what the specifics would be. I’m sorry, I have a lot of not-answers for you today, at some point. But I would say that as soon as we have some kind of action, we’ll let you know. But it’s not something I can remark on today.

QUESTION: Can you talk at all about if the sort of – like, writ large, if the department sees this as an ongoing threat as well from the Chinese?

MS BRUCE: Well, I – that would require me to speculate or talk about an opinion framework, which I can’t do certainly at this point. But we’ll have something for you soon.

Yes, ma’am."
260625,"Department Press Briefing – June 26, 2025","QUESTION: Thank you. Sir, I have two questions on China. One is that China reportedly is tracking down its rare-earth experts and seizing their passports. Can you please confirm that? And secondly, as the State Department increases scrutiny on the student visas of foreign students, particularly from China, I’m wondering if the department has concerns about the Chinese student associations in the U.S., given their ties to the Chinese consulates, and they have been described as a tool to extend Chinese influence.

MR PIGOTT: So on your first question, I’ll take that back, see if we can get you some details on that. On the second, on student visas and on our visa policies here in general, what I can say is that every single visa decision is a national security decision, and that’s something that Secretary Rubio takes incredibly seriously. And I think it’s – the American people want that to be taken seriously, the ability to properly vet certain rules, regulations. Every single visa decision is a national security decision no matter who you are applying for a visa. And that’s, like I said, something the Secretary takes very seriously.

So that’s all for today. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

050625,"Department Press Briefing – June 5, 2025","QUESTION: One more quick regarding the U.S. response to the South Korean presidential elections. The White House said that U.S. remains concerned about and opposes China’s interference and influence in democratic countries around the world. And the China want that the United States should stop its actions to sow discord in South Korea between China and South Korea relations. Can this be seen as a U.S. concern that this elected South Korean president is more pro-China than pro-United States?

MR PIGOTT: Look, what I can say is that we congratulate President Lee on his election as the president of the Republic of Korea. And on more details, I’ll take that question back to see if we can get you an answer on that."
030625,Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the American Compass Fifth Anniversary Gala,"SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bernie Moreno, how’s the Senate?  (Laughter.)

Thank you guys for having me.  It’s an honor.  I want to thank Chris for the introduction.  Did you get my office?  He just said – I just – the one I used to have, the one in Russell?  Yeah.  Did you find any cash or gold bars?  No.  (Laughter.)

Is there media here?  There’s – (laughter) – that’s what they call – it’s a joke.  It’s a joke.  You guys know.

Thank you, Chris, for that introduction, and actually very proud of the work you did with us on the Small Business Committee, and then Oren and everyone here at American Compass for hosting me here tonight.  A couple observations of seeing someone – we really only got to serve together for, like, 10 days, because I got confirmed pretty quickly.  And by the way, the President was so – and I got 99 out of a hundred votes because the Vice President, at the time his seat had not been filled, and the President for some period of time expressed great concern about the fact that I had 99 votes in the Senate.  He didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.  But I told him recently, sir, you don’t have to worry about that anymore.  I don’t think I’d get 99 votes now.  (Laughter.)

And anyways, but thank you for this chance to speak to you, and by – one more thing I want to tell you about:  I spent – now that I’m in the Executive Branch, we oftentimes have to deal with the fact that we want to do something and it’s like, well, but there’s a statute or there’s a law on the books that limit our ability to do things by executive action.  It requires us to go through certain steps.  And so I increasingly find myself saying who the hell wrote these laws, and in – today I was reminded it was actually me who passed a certain law that stood as an impediment to quick action.  So anyways, yeah, I’ve grown in my appreciation for the Executive Branch more and more each day.  And – but that’s also – the media’s going to say, oh, he’s for an authoritarian form of government.  No, I just – some of these laws I passed are getting in the way of my current life, so we have to work through it.  We will.

But thank you guys for this chance and the work that you’ve done, and I know that obviously you’re going to spend a lot of time focused on domestic decisions, but I want to hopefully pitch you a little bit tonight about what I’ve learned and what I already believed coming into this job, that so much about what happens domestically, economically is increasingly intertwined in geopolitics.  It always has been.  I think that’s one of the lessons we forgot, but I think we’ve been reminded of that here, most recently in a number of events that brought that to bear.

The first thing I would say is I think it’s always been true – one of the amazing things, one of the reasons why history repeats itself – people like to say that – is because human nature does not change.  Technologies change, the clothes we wear change, even languages change, governments change.  A lot of things change, but the one thing that is unchanged is human nature.  It’s the same today as it was 5,000 years ago, and that’s one of the reasons why history often repeats itself.

And one of the things about human nature – I’m not trying to sound like a psychologist here, but one of the things that I think history proves is that one of the things we are programmed as people with is the desire to belong.  In fact, if you notice, one of the – if you put humans anywhere, a handful of people anywhere, one of the first things they start doing is trying to create things that they can join or be a part of, and that’s true for nationhood and nation-states, the concept of nationhood.

Now, it’s a new concept.  I mean, before we all – but we had something.  It was like organizations, whether it was city-states or tribal organizations, but the advent of the nation-state is a normal evolution of human behavior because people think it’s important to belong to something, and being part of a nation is important.  And I think that’s really true, obviously, increasingly in how geopolitical decisions are made.

I think that’s obvious and people understand that, but it’s one of the things that we forgot.  And we certainly forgot it at the end of the Cold War.  If I can take you back to the end of the Cold War – and understand for me these were formative years, because I grew up in the ’80s, the greatest – probably the greatest decade ever, confirmed by the – yeah.  (Applause.) 

You know why I know this?  Because my kids – I have young – young – I say “young” and they’re, like, 24, 22, 20 – just turned 20 – and one who’s 17.  Every – all they do is watch reruns from the ’80s and ’90s.  They don’t make good TV anymore.  Everybody wants to watch stuff from the ’80s and ’90s, so that’s just my pitch.  The ’70s were a dark period of time because of disco music, but – and the ’80s just – got a disco fan back there.  But the ’80s, we did – the hair was a little too big, but other than that.

But going back, the ’80s, you grew up, and I remember in 1983 – now I’m aging – I just turned 54.  I feel 55, but I – and it must be 1983.  Do you guys remember a movie called the – oh, gosh, what was it?  It was about nuclear war.  Do you remember this?  It was 19 – no, War Games, that was a great movie.  I’m talking about one that was on TV that scared the hell out of me.  There was –

AUDIENCE:  The Day After.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  The Day After.  Do you remember that movie, The Day After?  This was traumatizing, and they had this thing on television.  But basically grew up understanding that the world at any moment could end because the United States and the Soviet Union were headed for conflict and war and that maybe we wouldn’t even make it to 25 and things of this nature.

I forgot about War Games.  War Games was another good movie, where this guy hacks into the computer.  This was an ’80s hacker.  This was not – I can remember the phone and the modem, and it was – what was that actor?  It was the same – Matthew Broderick.  It’s a great movie.  I know I’m completely off topic – (laughter) – but let me just tell you I lived in Las Vegas at the time, and if you recall, the first city that he blows up in the war games is Las Vegas.  And I was sitting in the audience and everybody was like chuckling – nothing funny about this Las Vegas strike.  (Laughter.)

In any event, so this is what we grew up in.  And then in 1989, in 1990 and ’91, it was my first years in college, and literally the entire world just transformed before my very eyes.  Understand you grew up your whole life, and like the whole world is about the Soviet Union, and all of a sudden the Soviet Union no longer exists.  My favorite memory of that is that I was actually taking a course that fall by a Soviet expert at – I think it was in Gainesville, Florida.  And this poor guy’s entire career came crumbling down over a three-month period as the Soviet Union collapsed.  It was like all these years of work, you have a PhD in Soviet studies, and now the Soviet doesn’t exist anymore.  So I don’t know what he did after that.  I need to check up on that guy.

But anyways, the point is the whole world transformed and there was this effusive exuberance, the belief that the Cold War is over, we won, and now the entire world is going to become just like us – free enterprise democracies.  That was a very idealistic thing to believe.

But here’s the other conclusion they made, and that is that everybody – that it didn’t – nationhood no longer mattered when it came to economics, that right now the world would no longer have borders.  It wouldn’t matter where things were made.  What mattered is they were made in the most efficient place.

And it became mantra.  And look, I think it became part of Republican orthodoxy for a very long time, an orthodoxy that I came up in, which was it’s okay if productive capacity moves to another country, because what that will do is it will free up our workers to do work that’s even more productive and pays them more.  It was the famous or the infamous idea that who cares that you lost your job at a factory, you’re going to learn how to code, and then you’re going to be – you’re going to make a lot more money doing that.

Well, it was completely unrealistic, number one, and became incredibly disruptive that that decision was made.  But here’s the other implication of it:  It robbed a nation of its industrial capacity, of its ability to make things.  And its industrial capacity and its ability to make things has two ramifications:  The first is it hurts your economy, it hurts your country, it robs people of jobs, and the transition is not nearly as easy, but it also ends up becoming corrosive and destructive to communities.  I mean, as a result we had a rust belt.  We had places that were gutted and we had families that for generations that worked in a certain field or for a certain company, and all of a sudden that company or that field vanished because it moved somewhere else where it was cheaper to do.  And those jobs were gone, and obviously it became incredibly destructive – not just for the United States, by the way, but for many nations in the industrialized West.

But the other thing it robbed us of is the ability to make things, which is a national security impediment – impairment – and a very significant one.  If you go back to the World War – World War II, the admiral who had been tasked with planning Pearl Harbor thought it was a really bad idea.  He went through and obviously followed orders, but he thought it was a very bad idea because he had spent a substantial amount of time studying in the United States when he was younger.  And his conclusion was that attacking the United States was a bad idea because even though at the time militarily we were behind the Japanese, certainly technologically and otherwise, we had factories and we had access to raw material and resources.  And he knew that over time, once those factories and those raw materials were put to the war machine, the Japanese would not be able to keep up.

And you could very well argue that the end of World War II, that the victory in World War II both in Europe and especially in Asia, was the result of America’s industrial capacity.  When the Japanese lost a plane, they lost a plane.  When we lost a plane – and their planes were better than ours for a long time.  When we lost a plane, we were able to produce hundreds to replace it.  Industrial capacity mattered in terms of national security, and that’s never changed.  That’s always been true. 

And so today, what you find is because of all of those years of neglect, because of the loss of industrial capacity, we didn’t just undermine our society, we didn’t just undermine our domestic economy, we’ve undermined our position in the world.  And what you will find and what we find even now is that increasingly, on geopolitical issue after geopolitical issue, it is access to raw material and industrial capacity that is at the core both of the decisions that we’re making and the areas that we’re prioritizing. 

It’s – now, the technologies are different, but nonetheless that is what we’re increasingly prioritizing.  And that’s become really apparent to me.  I think it was even going into this job, but in the months that I’ve been there, on place after place, every country in the world is now pitching themselves as a source of rare earth minerals.  Every country in the world – by the way, they’re not that rare, so every country has access to it, but it’s become a big – but that alone is not enough because you have to have access to rare earth minerals, but then you have to have the ability to process them and you have to have – to make them into usable material. 

And frankly, what the Chinese have done over the last 25 or 30 years is they’ve cornered the market.  And this is one of the true challenges to sort of pure free-enterprise view of these things.  You cannot compete with a nation-state who has decided they’re not interested in making money.  They don’t – they’re not interested in making money in this field.  They are interested in the short term in dominating the market, being the sole-source provider for the world of a certain product.  Because once you establish industry dominance in any one of these fields, you can charge the world whatever you want. 

Now, one thing is if we said:  Well, this happened because they’re just better than us.  But that’s not why it happened.  It happened because we literally gave it away.  Because we made the decision, we made the policy decision, that it was okay, we were okay with 80-something percent of the active ingredients in most of our generic pharmaceuticals coming from another country.  We were okay with giving that away.  We were okay with giving away all kinds of things like that.  And now, now we are in a crunch.  And I say “we.”  I mean the rest of the world is in a crunch, because we have realized that our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China, who can hold it over our head. 

And so in many ways the nature of geopolitics is now adjusted to that and is adjusting to that.  And it’ll be one of the great challenges of the new century and one of the priorities of this administration under President Trump is to reorient our domestic and the way we pursue geopolitics to take into account for the fact that you can never be secure as a nation unless you’re able to feed your people, and unless you’re able to make the things that your economy needs in order to function and ultimately to defend yourself. 

There is virtually none of the leading-edge industries of the 21st century in which we don’t have some level of vulnerability, and it’s become one of the highest geopolitical priorities that we now face – not simply access to raw material but figuring out how can we have more industrial capacities in these critical fields, ideally domestically, but if not here then diversify the global supply chain so that it cannot be used against us as a point of leverage at a time of potential conflict. 

In fact, unless we fix it, some of these conflicts will never happen because we will never be able to enter – the amount of leverage they will have on us will begin to constrain our ability to make foreign policy.  Unable to get into a tremendous amount of detail, let me just say that even as I speak to you now, there are a number of foreign policy issues in which we’re having to balance what we would ideally want to do with what we may not be able to do in the short term until we fix these problems.  This is a real challenge in American geopolitics, and it’s one that’s become a priority and goes right to the heart of the decisions that were made over the last 20 or 30 years that were – that were a mistake and that we’re now trying to correct.

The other, which is more broad but I think also ties to economic policy, is the following:  Part of the decisions that were made were, in the end, if something is good for the global economy, that’s really what matters.  Ultimately, a lot of public policy decisions were made without the nation-state in mind.  Rather, the decision was:  Is this good for the global economy?  Is this good for global economic growth?  Is this good for prosperity in other places even if it may not be in our interest? 

And we made those decisions even during the Cold War to some extent.  We allowed nations to treat us unfairly in trade, but we allowed them to do it because we didn’t want those countries to become victim to a communist revolution that would overthrow them.  But then we kept it going.  And so today there are multiple countries around the world that are fully developed economies, but whom we have enormous trade imbalances because they want to continue that system moving along.  And that has to be corrected.

But here’s the final point, and here’s why this is also critical.  Because not only did we take out nation-state interest and the national interest out of our economic policies; we also took it out of the way we made foreign policy decisions.  The idea that our foreign policy, depending on the place and on the issue, should be centered and focused primarily on what is good for the United States was completely lost.  Time and again, we made decisions in foreign policy because of what was good for the international order or what was good for the world.  And I’m not saying those things are irrelevant, but the number one priority of our foreign policy must – of the United States – the number one foreign policy priority of the United States needs to be the United States and what’s in the best interest of the United States.  (Applause.)

That’s not isolationism.  That’s common sense.  On the contrary, in order to do that, we have to engage in the world.  But we need to engage in the world in a way that prioritizes our national interest above all else.  And the reason why we do that goes back to my point at the outset of this, with human nature.  And that is:  That’s what other countries do all the time.  Virtually every single nation-state we interact with prioritizes their national interest in their interactions with us.  And we need to begin to do that again, and we’re beginning to do that again – prioritizing the national interest of the United States above everything else in making these foreign policy decisions.

And I’ll close by saying that’s where foreign policy works best.  As I’ve said to multiple foreign leaders, including some with whom we haven’t had engagements with for many years, I said the way foreign policy works best is when our national interests are aligned.  When they’re aligned, that’s where we have incredible opportunity for partnership together.  And when they’re not aligned, that’s where I expect them to pursue their national interest and us to pursue ours, and to do so peacefully if possible, and that’s the work of diplomacy. 

And so I think the work you have done to reorient our thinking towards the national interest – both in our domestic economic policies as well as in our foreign policies – is critical work for 21st century conservatism.  And I thank you for all the work you’ve provided.  You’ve done great work.  When no one else was talking about these things, when no one else was providing the material that allowed us to build public policy and challenge thinking, you were doing it.  And I encourage you to continue to do it because this is going to be the work of a generation.  It’s – there’s still much work to be done.  We are in the midst of an important and long-overdue realignment in our thinking in American politics, and it takes organizations like American Compass to drive the innovation and the thinking.  And we appreciate everything you’ve done up to this point and encourage you to continue to do that.

And one of the people who has really been a leader in this regard – someone who I actually got to know as part of this project and this thinking back when he was only a best-selling author and not even a political figure yet – is our current Vice President, who is doing a phenomenal job, and someone I’ve grown tremendous – my admiration for him has grown tremendously.  I admired him before.  I admired him in the Senate.  I admire him a lot more now as Vice President because I think vice presidents are just more impressive than senators, Bernie.  That’s all.  (Laughter.)  But I can say that now that I got 99 votes, see, because I don’t need their votes anymore.  (Laughter.)

But the Vice President is going a phenomenal job, and I think is one of the most powerful and clearest voices in the world – really at the edge, at the leading edge of this new thinking in American politics.  And it’s my honor to serve with him in this administration, and it’s my honor to invite him onto the stage now to speak to all of you.

So thank you for the opportunity to be here.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice President of the United States, JD Vance.  (Applause.)"
030625,On the 36th Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre,"In the spring of 1989, tens of thousands of students gathered in Beijing’s largest public square to mourn the passing of a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader who tried to steer China toward a more open and democratic system. Their actions inspired a national movement. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in the capital and throughout China took to the streets for weeks to exercise their freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly by advocating for democracy, human rights, and an end to rampant corruption. The CCP responded with a brutal crackdown, sending the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to open fire in an attempt to extinguish the pro-democracy sentiments of unarmed civilians gathered on Beijing’s streets and in Tiananmen Square.

The CCP actively tries to censor the facts, but the world will never forget. Today we commemorate the bravery of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989. Their courage in the face of certain danger reminds us that the principles of freedom, democracy, and self-rule are not just American principles. They are human principles the CCP cannot erase."
290525,"Department Press Briefing – May 29, 2025","2:05 p.m. EDT

MS BRUCE: Hi, everybody. I intended to come out a little bit early, anticipating our friend Karoline closing.

MR PIGOTT: Excuse me.

MS BRUCE: Hi, Tommy.

MR PIGOTT: I just wanted to make sure your badge is – I apologize.

MS BRUCE: Oh, my badge. It’s like I’ll never be able to function without my badge from this point forward. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

All right. I feel so unofficial now. Alrighty.

Yes, so our friend Karoline briefed today, which was terrific, and so here we are. Thank you, everybody. For everyone watching at home, welcome aboard. I appreciate it. We know that many streaming options – we know CSPAN carries this live as well, and it’s great to see all of you here.

Do have a couple of announcements here right at the top. Today, the State Department notified Congress on our reorganization plan to build an America First State Department capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. The Secretary issued a statement on the notification. As he said: “Over the past quarter century, the domestic operations of the State Department have grown exponentially, resulting in more bureaucracy, higher costs, and fewer results for the American people. Since my first day as Secretary, I have said that this department must move at the speed of relevancy, and in April announced a broad reorganization of the department to better achieve that goal. Today, we took the next step in that process by notifying Congress of how we plan to do that.”

Further, he said: “The plan submitted to Congress was the result of thoughtful and deliberative work by senior department leadership. We have taken into account feedback from lawmakers, bureaus, and long-serving employees. The reorganization plan will result in a more agile department, better equipped to promote America’s interests and keep Americans safe across the world.”

In addition, over the last few days Secretary Rubio has announced new visa policies that put America first. I’m sure none of you have any questions about those. (Laughter.) The State Department is determined to protect Americans’ right to free speech and to counter the malign influence and actions of the Chinese Communist Party.

The bottom line: We are using and will continue to use every tool in our tool chest to make sure that we know who it is who wants to come into this country and if they should be allowed to come in. Every sovereign nation has a right to secure its borders and to make sure they know who is in their nation and if they are safe to be here.

And finally, Secretary Rubio met with the North Macedonian minister of foreign affairs today and his delegation. I had the pleasure of being at that meeting as well. The meeting underscored the strong relationship between the United States and North Macedonia, and highlighted mutual interests in regional stability, economic cooperation, and NATO. They explored opportunities to expand the economic collaboration, which would include energy, trade, and investment.

A fabulous delegation; it was a pleasure to meet them. And now it’s a pleasure to see you guys again, even though I’ve met most of you, maybe not all of you, taking your questions. Shall – Matt?

QUESTION: Yes, please.

MS BRUCE: Do you want – I know you’ve got a few things on your mind.

QUESTION: Yeah. Well, yes. So I assume you were being sarcastic when you said that I know none of you have questions about the visa policy.

MS BRUCE: Of course. Yes, sarcasm is my – is my favorite thing.

QUESTION: Yes. So anyway, I do have a couple questions, but I’ll keep them brief.

MS BRUCE: Sure.

QUESTION: On the visa policy, specifically as it relates to China and the Chinese students, the statement that came out last night was – it wasn’t very specific, shall we say, about what affiliations with the Chinese Communist Party and what critical areas of study would the applicants for visas under those would be – would be subjected to more scrutiny. So I’m wondering if there is an answer to what is the actual Chinese Communist Party affiliation that would make you ineligible for a visa, or what is the – what is – what are examples of the critical areas in which – will be subject to —

MS BRUCE: Well, since starting here at the State Department in January, I have been impressed with a number of things – most everything. But also learning about the nature of the visas – and I’ve said here regularly, as many people watching around the world might not know – is that we don’t give details about what our methods are regarding visas. Of course, everyone is vetted. I think if you’ve gone through the process, it’s about filing for a visa, and then you have to have a meeting. And you do it in your home country, your consulate, your embassy, and that’s the process. So there is a vetting; there always has been.

What we don’t discuss – again, because of privacy issues, but also because it’s different for each person – that there are a series of dynamics that can be applied, questions that can be asked, issues looked at, and we use every tool that we have to vet and to make sure we know who’s coming in.

In this particular case, the United States is putting America first by beginning to revoke visas of Chinese students as warranted, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party – as you mentioned, Matt – or studying in critical fields, and enhancing scrutiny of visas for all Chinese nationals, including Hong Kong passport holders.

I will not be getting into the details not only of what the details are regarding the scrutiny and the methods regarding the visa itself, but also when it comes to critical fields. I was rather pleased, having seen very often announcements that don’t really give any information – and there’s reasons for that; for national security, because there’s negotiations, it’s diplomatic, et cetera – or giving away the nature of how we choose to do things might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.

In this case, when we think of critical fields, which is obviously a very specific phrase, we think about national security, the nature of how we keep America safe and secure and more prosperous. And it is important to have, I think, a broad base because that could mean something different to many people. It could mean many things, and this is going to be up to the people making the decisions. And I think that that’s in the framework of what we’ve discussed regarding the visa actions as well when it comes to keeping America safe.

The United States, I further can say here, will not tolerate the CCP’s exploitation of U.S. universities or theft of U.S. research, intellectual property, or technologies to grow its military power, conduct intelligence collection, or repress voices of opposition. The Trump Administration is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding our national security and public safety through our visa process, obviously very openly and transparently applied by Secretary Marco Rubio.

Every visa adjudication is a national security decision – every single one of them. Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home. So we’ve experienced this through these last several weeks. It is something that is at the heart and at really at the front line of protecting the country, and we’re taking it seriously and we’re being open about the nature of what’s happening in this particular instance.

QUESTION: Okay. So could I just ask, that last bit that you just said, which was not in the statement last night and is a little bit more specific about —

MS BRUCE: Oh yeah, about the nature of the theft of certain things.

QUESTION: Just that last – yes, the last bit.

MS BRUCE: Well, we – again, as reporters here all and curious people, you know the nature of what China has been doing about – with technology, right; stealing information, intellectual property, U.S. research, copyrights, et cetera. It’s – this is not new or confusing, and this is one way that we certainly can try to mitigate that issue.

QUESTION: Thank you.

MS BRUCE: Yes, Andrea Mitchell.

QUESTION: Tammy, let me – I wanted to follow-up on that, and then I’m going to ask you about Hamas and Gaza and Israel.

MS BRUCE: Of course. Certainly.

QUESTION: Is there any re-evaluation of TikTok and its vulnerabilities, as was defined by the previous administration as dangerous for national security reasons? Does the White House or – well, does the administration have any re-evaluation of TikTok in this context as you’re cracking down on Chinese intelligence gathering?

MS BRUCE: I would say you’d have to send that question – ask that at the White House. What we do know though, of course, is that we’re serious about Chinese intervention here, if you will, and the nature of what’s driving, of course, this new visa vetting dynamic. But for that specifically, I know the President has spoke on it. You’ll need to ask the White House.

QUESTION: And then I ask you about the —

MS BRUCE: Yes.

QUESTION: — possibility of a tentative acceptance by Israel of a ceasefire.

MS BRUCE: Could we – let me come back to you on that. I think many of you also have the visa questions, correct? Are we dealing —

QUESTION: Right.

MS BRUCE: Let’s stick with visas because there’s many different issues at hand, not just this one regarding China.

So Daphne.

QUESTION: The European issue as well?

MS BRUCE: Yeah, we’ll get to Gaza after that. Yes.

QUESTION: Thank you. There are hundreds of thousands of Chinese students currently in the U.S. What proportion does the State Department expect will face visa revocations?

MS BRUCE: Oh, I can’t answer that at all. I mean, one of the things we also – even if I was inclined to want to answer, is we’re not going to speculate on where this would go. A lot of this clearly is – perhaps has not been done before as we look at this dynamic and make a determination of exactly what’s been happening in this country. A great deal of what President Trump has done and what Secretary Rubio is doing is beginning to look at certain things, whether it’s foreign aid, the nature of visas, how people are getting here, what’s happening at the universities, the things we’ve seen that we don’t like that have emerged from them.

But I certainly would not hazard to suggest that the numbers matter. What the story is here is that the issue of being serious about safety for the country matters, and we’re going to look at that at every single front. So I think it’s less about numbers and more about the fact that we’re keeping America safe and taking the actions that we need to do to do that.

QUESTION: At the tail end of Trump’s first administration, the U.S. revoked visas for more than a thousand Chinese students and researchers that were deemed security risks. Should we expect the actions that Secretary Rubio announced yesterday to exceed those first-term measures?

MS BRUCE: Gosh, you love the numbers. She loves the numbers. Daphne from Reuters.

How many originally did you say Chinese students were here?

QUESTION: Hundreds of thousands.

MS BRUCE: Hundreds of thousands. And so you’ve provided a number of about a thousand, which I’m not quite sure how that number even would have been a number that you could rely on because Consular Affairs does not provide numbers. We don’t discuss visas that are issued, visas that are removed, things that are revoked. Those are numbers that are not shared, are not provided, and I would suggest using caution if someone is giving you a number like that.

Again, I have no idea what the numbers will be. What I do know is that the people who are deemed to be a threat to the country or a problem now will be vetted again or looked at seriously, and Americans will be safer. That’s the story here.

QUESTION: And then just on the visa restriction policy announced yesterday over the censoring of Americans, can you provide any specific examples of what actions prompted the U.S. to institute this policy? And when might we expect any visa restrictions to be implemented?

MS BRUCE: In a case like this, you’re looking at a policy that is a reflection of what the Trump Administration and the American people care about, which is the idea of Americans being censored. We experienced this through COVID, the nature of our ability to be able to speak our minds. And while I won’t give you – or can give you or would give you specifics about how this would – this particular restriction would be approached, which is not done in a blanket way – right? – that there is individuals who are flagged or who are seen as being a participant in some aspect of the censorship of Americans, what I can say is that all of what you see emanating from the Trump Administration and the State Department is a reflection of the policy of this administration and what the American people want and expect when it comes to what their futures are going to hold.

QUESTION: On the same?

MS BRUCE: Again, on visas?

QUESTION: Yes.

MS BRUCE: Hold on please.

QUESTION: A different one?

QUESTION: Still on visas.

MS BRUCE: Still on visas. One moment. I’ll be back with you.

QUESTION: Thank you.

MS BRUCE: Yes.

QUESTION: One, on the cable that went out on Tuesday, it said they expected this expanded social media vetting guidance for visa applicants to go out in the coming days. Are you still tracking that timeline?

MS BRUCE: Yes.

QUESTION: And can you give us any guidance on what that is going to look like?

MS BRUCE: Yes. I can’t give you a specific timeline, but there will be more information. What I can say is that, in general, if – because that was an internal communication that was leaked. At the same time, we have confirmed that it’s – the details are accurate. Also, the Trump Administration is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through the visa process specifically. Every adjudication, as I noted to you, is a national security decision.

And a visa, as a reminder, is not a privilege – it’s a privilege; it’s not a right. It’s not a birthright. It’s not something that you’re owed, no matter where you come from. Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. And this is important with these conversations because it seems like only certain groups are facing vetting with visas. Every single person does. So I would say that, yes, you’re going to get more information. And this is, as a result, not an interminable kind of end – there is an endpoint, and it should be rather quick, as consulates and embassies make adjustments when it comes to how they handle visas.

QUESTION: Can we expect the appointments to open back up immediately after that guidance goes out to posts?

MS BRUCE: Well, one thing I can tell you – a few things I can say is people can still make their application, do their regular steps, but it’s a two-step process, right. You apply and then you have to get an appointment to meet with people to talk with them. Unlike – I don’t know – unlike – often with the passports – I mean, there’s a very specific process. So right now, there might be some delay. And what I’m told to encourage people to do is to regularly check to see when those spaces open. So as opposed to – let me just say, I would not be recommending that if this was going to be weeks or months. So if you’re – if you’ve applied for a visa, and you want to, please do. Then if there’s no – if you’re not getting an appointment, just – there’s an online system. You continually recheck to see when those spots might open. I can’t tell you immediately after some indetermined moment of an action, but I can tell you that it’s something that would happen perhaps sooner than later.

QUESTION: And then one more. On Harvard, my understanding is you are now reviewing all of the visas of Harvard-affiliated visa holders, not just students. Can you confirm that? And why is this broader review taking place? Do you expect it to impact medical professionals, for example, professors at the university?

MS BRUCE: I – again, I hesitate only because all of this is regarding visas and the nature of our mission and the approach that we take regarding who is being scrutinized and how we’re going to approach. So I’m – we’re going to put that off. I think we probably will have a bit more on that next week perhaps, but we’ll put that off now. But what I can say clearly, with all of the news over the last 48 hours, is that the visa process is a key component of keeping the country safe. It is not targeted at certain only specific individuals. This is an overarching national security action, and we are acting quickly. Obviously, we’re a nation that loves people coming here the legal way, and we want to help facilitate that but not at our own risk.

Shaun.

QUESTION: Sure. More on the visas. If I – if you don’t mind me emphasizing, as Daphne and Matt asked you on the language. The Secretary’s statement yesterday –
“aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections” – it’s not specific. He’s not saying specifically those with connections. So, I mean, there are 277,000 Chinese students in the United States. I mean, should all of them feel that they’re at some risk of having their visas revoked?

MS BRUCE: I think everyone who’s here on a visa has to recognize – certainly as what they’ve seen over the last few months – that America takes their visas seriously, that vetting is not a one-time process – it’s continuing – and that when things – if things happen, if you get arrested, if there is some kind of an issue, it – you’re – it’s probably going to be seen at some point. But I do think that with this particular dynamic, it’s clear that there is an interest in making sure that those who are here from China on a visa understand that we are taking our national security seriously and we are looking at their visas. And if everything is fine, terrific. But that will be a vetting that certainly continues and is important, clearly, to the administration.

QUESTION: Okay. And a bit broader. I mean, you said if everything is fine, you’re welcome. More broadly, all these things that are going on with the student visas, with the vetting, with the suspension for now of new appointments – I mean, is it still a priority for the administration to encourage students to come to the United States? They have other options. It’s been said that Hong Kong, for example, is now saying students at Harvard – doctoral students – have a fast-track over there.

MS BRUCE: Sure. Yeah.

QUESTION: Is there any concern that the U.S. is losing a competition? After all, there’s $50 billion into the economy of – from international students.

MS BRUCE: Yeah, well, people come here because this is where you start new lives, where you have every opportunity in the world. There’s a reason why people come here. It’s because of what the country represents, yes, the excellence of our schools. And we want to keep it that way. We want parents who send their children – whether they be from a different country or America – to an American university that they can recognize their child when that child returns home, and that child actually has skills and an education that can improve their future, that can get them a job, that can help facilitate the dreams that they’ve had, as opposed to political indoctrination or the idea of just activism or a certain political framework that they move out with.

This should be an education that is literally liberal – the idea that you learn things that help facilitate your life no matter where you come from, who you are, if you’re a Jew or a non-believer, or an atheist, or black, or white, or a woman. We’ve been through this in this country for the last two to three generations still, and our focus is making sure that everyone who does want to send their child to a school in this country can do so knowing that they’re going to be safe, they’re going to be able to get into a building and not held hostage in a library because it’s been occupied, or that they’re going to be able to actually learn things that you’re paying that kind of money for. So yes, it not only should encourage more people, for those who are already here, it’s certainly an important dynamic for believing and understanding that your child’s going to be safe and that you’re going to get something that you’ve paid for more than a social activist who lives in your basement."
280525,"New Visa Policies Put America First, Not China","Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. We will also revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong."
220525,Deputy Secretary Landau’s Call with Chinese Executive Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu ,"The below is attributable to Spokesperson Tammy Bruce:

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau spoke today with Chinese Executive Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu.  They acknowledged the importance of the bilateral relationship to the people of both countries and the world, discussed a wide range of issues of mutual interest, and agreed on the importance of keeping open lines of communication."
210525,"Secretary of State Marco Rubio Before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on the FY26 Department of State Budget Request
","SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.  I’ll try to stay under the five minutes and – so we can get time for questions here.

So when I took this job – and I said this during my confirmation hearing – the most important thing we need to do is return American foreign policy to be centered on our national interests.  For far too long, that had been lost as a concept of foreign policy.  In essence, in many cases, oftentimes the U.S. engaged in the world on the basis of what was good for the global order or the international community and what like.  And look, for about 30 years, that made a lot of sense – until the end of the post-Cold War era.

(Protest utterances.)

So that made a lot of sense for a long period of time during the Cold War.  But then we entered the post-Cold War era, and the war – and the world order has rapidly changed.  We entered a new era about 12 or 14 years ago when we entered an era of near-peer competition, where, for the first time since the end of the Cold War, the United States had a near-peer competitor and adversary in the state of China.  And we need to confront that, and our foreign policy needs to be geared around that and all the realities of this new world.

And so what that means is we have to have a State Department that can deliver on a foreign policy that is rooted in the national interests of the United States.  To defend the national interests of the United States requires us, number one, to make sure that every dollar we spend and every action we take has to have measurable outcomes that deliver for the American people.  They have to either make our country safer or they have to make our country stronger or they have to help make our country more prosperous.  It has to do at least one of those three things, and ideally, whether it’s a program or a measure that we take, it should do all three of them.

Now, that – what that means is that there are some great causes in the world.  There really are.  There are some great causes.  There are some horrifying things that are happening on the planet.  America cannot solve every single one of them.  What we need to focus on is prioritizing our foreign policy to those areas that are in our national interests.

Now, we will still remain the largest contributor of foreign aid and humanitarian assistance on this planet, by far.  The United States, even under the budget that’s before you today and the changes we have made, will still contribute more in foreign aid than the next 10 countries combined, than the entire OECD or the next closest country.  It’s not China.  It’s Germany, and it’s way behind us even now.  But that foreign aid has to be geared towards our foreign – to our national interests.  We need to design a State Department that delivers on that.

Yes, we canceled a bunch of contracts in USAID.  Some were stupid and outrageous.  Others didn’t serve the national interest.  And others we kept.  And we are folding it under the Department of State.  And you know why?  Because we want it to be part of the toolbox of foreign policy, not a standalone.  It is not charity.  Foreign aid is not charity.  It is designed to further the national interests of the United States"
200525,Secretary of State Marco Rubio Before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the FY26 Department of State Budget Request ,"SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  It’s an honor to be here on behalf of the National Archives and in addition to —

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Yeah.  We don’t have time for you to list —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Okay.  Well, we’ll focus on State today.  (Laughter.)

I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.  When I came here four months ago, I told you that what I wanted was a State Department that was at the heart and soul of American foreign policy, that it was the single biggest driver both of action but also of ideas, and we’re well on our way to achieving that.  And the way we’ve – I’ll talk about some of the individual things we’ve accomplished during that time, but first, let me explain sort of some of the processes by which we seek to arrive at it.

The first is a reorganization of the way the State Department functions, and we have sort of previewed that with the committee and many of the individual members.  Obviously, we’ll have to come – we’ve taken input and are taking input now through the notice process, and then we’ll come back to you with a formal congressional notification once – but we are taking a lot of the input, both provided by individual members and your staff but also from inside the building.

But if I could simplify, the goal is this, and that is –

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Yeah.  All right.  First —

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Carry on.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  The goal is to drive power and action in our agency to the regional bureaus and to our embassies.  On everything we do, we want our foreign policy to be holistic.  So, for example, we recognize that the set of factors both in diplomacy and foreign aid in Guatemala or in Trinidad or in Jamaica are going to look different than they may somewhere in Africa, somewhere in the Indo-Pacific region.  And we want those decisions, and the influence over those decisions to be made, to be driven to the regional bureaus.  And so what we’ve done is we’ve taken a lot of the functional bureaus and functional processes and moved them under the purview of the regional bureaus and the career individuals that serve there and ultimately down to the embassy.

One of our first tests, Senator Shaheen, is going to be in Syria.  We don’t have an embassy in Syria.  It’s operating out of Türkiye.  But we need to help them.  We want to help that government succeed because the alternative is full-scale civil war and chaos, which would of course destabilize the entire region.  And we are going to allow our people on the ground – both our embassy personnel at the Damascus embassy located in Türkiye and, for the short period of time, at least during the interim, our ambassador in Türkiye – to work with local officials there to make determinations about what kind of aid they need.  Is it humanitarian?  Is it improving law enforcement or governance functions?  We think it’s going to be the first test of this new model, but I strongly believe that our decisions and the power to drive decisions and the decisions and the inputs that we’re taking have to be driven in many cases from the bottom up, not from the top down, and focused on the fact that there is unique sets of factors in individual parts of the world that require different priorities and attention.

And ultimately, foreign policy – mature foreign policy – requires a balancing of interests.  That’s just a fact, okay?  Our human rights agenda is going to look different in certain parts of the world than it will in others.  That doesn’t mean that we as a people have abandoned it.  That means that in a world where you need to conduct real foreign policy in a mature and structured way, there are ways you’re going to have to balance all these —

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Actually, Senator Rubio, there’s – we’re making progress.  There’s protests in English now, so —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Remember last time?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  So we have to understand that, and that’s why we think it’s so important that our regional bureaus be at the core and at the heart of everything we do.  And so we feel good about that part of it.

By the same token, I think critical to this are some of the reforms we’re trying to make to foreign aid.  And I said, when I appeared before this committee, everything we do has to make us stronger, safer, or more prosperous.  So we’ve undertaken a review of our foreign aid, and the reality is that there are many of these programs – they may – some are good programs.  Some make all the sense in the world, and we wanted to pursue those programs.

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Go ahead.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Some of these programs make all the sense in the world, but frankly, on the priority scale, perhaps other programs are more important.  Others, frankly, made no sense at all.  We can talk about some of those programs today.  We funded things around the world that made absolutely no sense.

I will say this:  Even with the reforms we’ve put in place and what we’re suggesting as changes to our foreign aid, we still will provide more foreign aid, more humanitarian support than the next 10 countries combined, than the entire OECD, and far more than China.  China doesn’t do humanitarian aid.  China does predatory lending.  That’s what Belt and Road Initiative is.  That’s what all of their aid – they have no – zero record of doing humanitarian aid in the world, and frankly, they don’t know how to do it.  They have no interest in doing it.  What they’re very good at is going into some country, making you a loan, and then holding that debt over your head.  And that’s what they continue to do, and by the way, you have to hire a Chinese company to do it.

So I don’t agree with this assessment that – there’s no evidence whatsoever that China has either the capacity or the will to replace the U.S. in humanitarian assistance, in food deliveries, or in developmental assistance, for that matter.  We provide development assistance.  They provide debt traps, and that’s a point over and over again around the world that we’ve made, and we’ve found receptive audiences to it.

Now, look, anytime you undertake reforms of this magnitude, of – that needed to be made, you’re going to have hiccups and you’re also going to have controversy.  But these reforms had to happen.  At USAID, 12 cents of every dollar was reaching the recipient.  That means that in order for us to get aid to somebody, we had to spend all this other money supporting this foreign aid industrial complex.  We’re going to find more efficient ways to deliver aid to people directly, and it’s going to be directed by our regional bureaus, and it’s going to sponsor programs that make a difference, and it’s going to be part of a holistic approach to our foreign policy.  And I look forward to engaging with this committee and the appropriators as well in ensuring that we get to the right place on that.

I – my last point I would make, and this is something I am very proud of – I believe – and I’m not besmirching anyone else, but I believe that the approach we have taken at the State Department – and, frankly, at USAID, but at the State Department – to move forward reforms that involved intake from all of our partners, that required that input from people within the building – many of the reforms we’ve made were driven by people inside the building, many of whom have worked there for 20 or 30 years.  And now we are engaged with Congress, both in the House and Senate, in a comment period where we’re taking many of your comments and are making changes to our organizational proposals that we look forward to bringing back to you with an official congressional notification.  And even after that there’ll be an opportunity to move forward.

But the State Department had to change.  I’m telling you it was no longer at the center of American foreign policy.  It had often been replaced by the National Security Council or by some other agency of government when, in fact, we have these highly talented people who – many of whom have served in multiple posts around the world and have a holistic view of how foreign policy needs to be conducted that were being edged out.  Because you know what?  When I get a decision memo early on at the State Department and they would hand me these memos, there were 40 boxes on this piece of paper.  That means 40 people had to check off yes, okay before it even got to me.  That’s ridiculous.  That takes too long.  That’s why people said don’t use State Department.  They take too long and it’s too cumbersome.  And if any one of those little boxes didn’t get checked, the memo didn’t move up the chain.

That can’t continue.  We can’t move at that pace in this world.  Events happen quickly, and we have to be able to move at the pace of relevance.  And so I hope to work with you in a productive way to make that possible.  You’re not going to like all the changes, but I want you to know what the intent of the changes are.  It is not to dismantle American foreign policy and it is not to withdraw us from the world, because I just hit 18 countries in 18 weeks.  That doesn’t sound like much of a withdrawal.  And I see some of these foreign ministers, including individuals from Ukraine, more than I’ve seen my own children, and I talk to them at least three times a week.  We are engaged in the world, but we’re going to be engaged in a world that makes sense and that’s smart.  And that isn’t about saving money; it is about ensuring that we are delivering to our people what they deserve: a foreign policy that makes America stronger, safer, and more prosperous.

Thank you."

140525,Imposing Sanctions on China- and Iran-based Entities and Individuals that Support Iran’s Ballistic Missile Program,"Today, the United States is sanctioning entities and individuals primarily based in China and Hong Kong for their support to Iran’s ballistic missile program.  Iran remains heavily reliant on China to conduct its malign activities in the Middle East.  This is another example of how the CCP and China-based companies provide key economic and technical support to Iran and its proxies driving regional instability and threatening U.S. partners and allies.

Specifically, these entities and individuals are supporting Iran’s efforts to indigenize the manufacturing of carbon fiber for use in Iran’s ballistic missile program.  These entities and individuals support the supply of carbon fiber, its precursors, and carbon fiber manufacturing equipment to the various Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) sub-organizations that oversee this effort, including U.S.-designated IRGC Aerospace Force Research and Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization (IRGC ASF RSSJO) and IRGC Research and Self Sufficiency Jehad Organization (IRGC RSSJO).

Today’s action is part of President Trump’s National Security Presidential Memorandum-2, which employs maximum pressure to curtail Iran’s ballistic missile program and disrupt, degrade, and deny the IRGC and its terrorist proxies the resources necessary to sustain their destabilizing activities.

The United States will use all available means, including sanctions on entities based in third countries, to expose and disrupt Iran’s schemes to procure equipment and items supporting its ballistic missile program, which destabilizes the Middle East and beyond.

The Department of Treasury’s action was taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their supporters."
130525,"Department Press Briefing – May 13, 2025","And finally, the President has secured another win for American workers: an initial agreement with China to reduce China’s tariffs and set a path for future discussions to open market access for American exports. As President Trump has said, the U.S. will continue to prioritize fairness, reciprocity, and results. The American people are already seeing the benefits: Inflation is down, grocery and gas prices are falling, and optimism is returning across the country. President Trump is once again delivering on his promise to make America great again.

And before I take questions, I would like to thank Spokesperson Tammy Bruce and the entire team for its unwavering support. It is an honor to be here and I look forward to answering your questions for the American people. And with that, I’ll take some questions."
080525,"Department Press Briefing – May 8, 2025","QUESTION: Thank you, Tammy. I just have a question about the meeting on – over the weekend – next weekend. Secretary of Treasury is meeting with the Chinese economic delegates over the weekend, so I’m just wondering: has State Department played any part in that – in scheduling that meeting? Or can you also share how that meeting is scheduled?

MS BRUCE: Well, these are trade talks in Switzerland?

QUESTION: Yes, that’s –

MS BRUCE: Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and USTR Ambassador Jamieson Greer will discuss trade with their Chinese counterpart in that instance, in Switzerland. At President Trump’s direction, the United States is negotiating with countries to rebalance – as you all know, because I’ve said it so many times – to rebalance our trade relations, to achieve reciprocity, open new markets, and protect America’s economic and national security. President Trump’s tariffs on China exist because of China’s longstanding unfair trade practices and its decision to retaliate instead of seeking a path forward.

All right? And I’ll check one more time here with our bullpen. How are we doing? We’re good?"
080525,Third China-Based “Teapot” Refinery Designated for Violating Iran Sanctions,"The United States is sanctioning China-based independent “teapot” refinery Hebei Xinhai Chemical Group Co., Ltd. and three oil terminal operators for their role in purchasing or facilitating the delivery of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil.

Additionally, the United States is designating numerous firms, vessels, and vessel captains involved in facilitating the transportation of Iranian oil to China as part of Iran’s “shadow fleet,” which funds Iran’s destabilizing behavior and support to terrorist proxies.

This is the United States’ third action against a China-based independent teapot refinery since President Trump issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 on February 4, 2025.

So long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, the United States will hold both Iran and all its partners in sanctions evasion accountable.

Today’s action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13902, which targets Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors, and E.O. 13846, which targets Iranian petroleum exports. This action also marks the latest round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since the President issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 (NSPM-2), instituting a campaign of maximum pressure on Iran. For more information on today’s action, please see the Department of the Treasury’s press release."

QUESTION: As you know.

MS BRUCE: Well, I can’t speak about that particular issue. But of course, Secretary Rubio has made his position clear about the kinds of individuals who are going to have their visas revoked or not – not renewed, involving whether or not their actions affect our foreign policy interests, or the opposite of what it is they said that they would be doing here, if they engage in certain kind of behavior. So but what we will do is see how the Secretary feels about this, and I do expect to talk with him a little bit later, but so we’ll take that back and get it back to you, because I know you’re going to be reporting on that. But we’ll do that.

QUESTION: Thank you very much, Tammy. I have two questions, one on the U.S. diplomatic missions, another one is China and Russia, if I may. Regarding the closure of U.S. diplomatic missions overseas, can you confirm that the United States is considering closing the diplomatic missions in 27 countries around the world? And will it also close its consulate in Busan, South Korea?

And the second question: It has been reported that Chinese companies are producing missiles in Russia, and that Russia’s Kremlin announced that it would strengthen solidarity with China to celebrate the Victory Days. What are your concerns about China and Russia’s military cooperating?

MS BRUCE: Well, what I’ve said several times in this podium is that there are several nations that are responsible for helping move the carnage that is unfolding in Ukraine in this war, that many nations are responsible for the nature of how it continues. And I’ve stated that several times, the State Department has as well, and so I’m going to leave that there.

Regarding our missions and our consulates, I have nothing to report for you at this point regarding the nature of what will be transpiring, but I will ask if we can take another look at perhaps – if there are announcements or any updates on that particular dynamic, we’ll get back to you, certainly."
010525,Secretary of State Marco Rubio with Sean Hannity of Fox News,"QUESTION:  And welcome to Hannity.  We start tonight with a Fox News alert.  At this hour, President Trump delivering a spirited commencement address at the University of Alabama.  We will check in with that live in just a few moments.  But first, a major announcement from the White House.  Mike Waltz has been nominated now to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio will now fill in as Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor while continuing to lead the State Department. 

Now, in case you’re keeping track, this means that Secretary of State Rubio is now the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Acting USAID Administrator, and the Acting Archivist.  I mean, you’ve got a lot.  Now on X, Vice President J.D. Vance actually was very funny, remarking, quote, “I think he could take on a bit more.  If only there was a job opening for a devout Catholic…”  When does conclave start?  I think the 7th.

Here now with more is Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  Mr. Secretary, you’ve got to admit that was pretty funny.  I like that.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, we thought about it, but you have to – it’s an unmarried Catholic male.  You don’t have to be a priest.  Any – people don’t know that.  Any unmarried Catholic male can be pope, but I got married and I’m happily married, so I guess I’ll miss out on that one.

QUESTION:  I know.  And by the way, you have a great – you’ve got a great family and your son’s a great football player and I know you’re very proud, and you should be. 

Look, we’ve been friends a long time.  Really – and I’m happy for Mike Waltz, by the way.  I think he’ll be a great UN ambassador, and we need one.  And you – your wheelhouse has always been foreign policy.  I’ve known you forever.  This is your passion.  Your heart is here.  These are consequential times.  We’ve got Europe, we’ve got Russia-Ukraine, we’ve got the Middle East, we have Iran, and then we have this – our number one geopolitical foe, China. 

Let’s start in Europe.  Let’s start with Putin.  You said this week may be the deciding week for him.  Clearly, the minerals deal yesterday was a big win for the President and the White House.  Where do we stand with Putin?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, let’s remind everybody this is not our war.  I mean, this is a war that started under Joe Biden.  For three years it went on.  They made no effort to sort of bring it to a conclusion.  And it’s a war that has no military solution:  in essence, Putin can’t take all of Ukraine; Ukraine can’t push the Russians all the way back to where they were in 2014. 

And so the question here is, who is the only leader in the world that can talk to both sides and hopefully bring them to a deal, and that’s President Trump.  And that’s what he’s tried to do.  For a hundred days he has done efforts to bring about peace, to end the killing, to end the dying, to end the destruction.  You know that Ukraine – it’s going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild that country.

And so the President has tried.  Look, we’ve gotten closer.  We – for the first time – we haven’t known this for three years – we kind of can see what it would take for Ukraine to stop.  We can see what it would take for the Russians to stop.  The problem is those two positions are still a little far apart. 

And look, we’re not going to give up on it in the sense that we’re not going to be ready to help if we can, but there does come a point where the President has to decide how much more time at the highest levels of our government do you dedicate it, when maybe one of the two sides or both aren’t really close enough when we’ve got so many – I would argue even more important – issues going on around the world.  Not that a war in Ukraine is not important, but I would say what’s happening with China is more important in the long term for the future of the world.  Obviously, Iran’s nuclear ambition, all these other things that we have going on.

So at some point in time, it either has to be something that can happen or we all need to move on.  That’ll be a decision the President will have to make. 

QUESTION:  Well, I will say this:  The consequences are really dire in every situation that you’re referring to.  Let me go back to Putin for one more second.  I mean, the mineral deal – I don’t think we can under – I don’t think we can overstate how important that’s going to be for Ukraine’s security, the relationship they will have now moving forward with the United States.  That’s a big part of the puzzle.

It’s important, I think, for people to understand in the four years when Donald Trump was president from 2017 till he left office in 2021, no problems with Vladimir Putin.  But in 2014, 11 years ago, that’s when Crimea was annexed.  When Joe Biden was president and Putin was amassing troops on the border and military equipment on the border, he’s asked, well what happens if he invades?  Of course he was going to invade.  He said well, it depends if it’s a minor incursion. 

And it makes you wonder – nobody ever dared to pick up a phone and even attempt or try to stop it from happening.  That to me is unconscionable.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.

QUESTION:  In your heart, do you feel like – are you close?  I mean, you’re in the middle of this.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  Well, I’m glad you gave everybody that lesson because that’s – not only did it happen in 2014 under President Obama, but during that time the Obama administration refused to provide the Ukrainians any military weapons.  They would provide them blankets and sheets and towels and – but they wouldn’t give them weapons.

Donald Trump, when he was president the first time, provided them the weapons that actually helped stop the Russian tanks from taking Kyiv even when he was no longer in the White House a few years later.  This invasion would have never happened if Donald Trump were in the White House, but it did.  It happened under Joe Biden.  It happened just a few months after the fiasco in Afghanistan.  And I think everyone realizes Putin saw that and said now is my time to go, I have a weak president under Joe Biden, and he went.  And this war dragged on for three years.

Look, you asked how close we are.  I think we know where Ukraine is and we know where Russia is right now and where Putin is.  They’re still far apart.  They’re closer, but they’re still far apart.  And it’s going to take a real breakthrough here very soon to make this possible, or I think the President is going to have to make a decision about how much more time we’re going to dedicate to this.

And you’re right about the minerals deal.  It’s good for America because we’ve invested a lot of money in this war.  It’s also good for Ukraine because it’s going to help them be able to develop their economy and rebuild when this war ends. 

QUESTION:  Well, they’re going to need a lot of money to rebuild. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  They are.

QUESTION:  Okay, let’s move to the Middle East and let’s move to what happens in Gaza.  It can no longer remain a launching pad for their missiles, Hamas missiles, to be fired into Israel.  That we agree on.  I know the President has said and you have said and Steve Witkoff has said – everybody has said – the Iranians cannot have a nuclear weapon.  The only reason they’re close is because Joe Biden put a blind eye towards the sanctions that were bankrupting Iran, as far as I’m concerned.

However, they are closer than they have ever been.  To me, a deal with Iran would have to include the following: Their enrichment would have to be stopped, their facilities shut down by Americans; we would need anywhere anyplace anytime American inspectors, not international inspectors.  Why in my heart of hearts do I not believe that the mullahs of Iran would ever agree to that, and do you agree that those should be the conditions?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  If Iran wants a peaceful civil nuclear program, meaning they want nuclear power plants like other countries in the world have, there’s a way to do it.  And that is you build the reactors and you import enriched uranium to fuel those reactors.  That’s how dozens of countries around the world do it.

The only countries in the world that enrich uranium are the ones that have nuclear weapons.  Iran is at – they’re claiming they don’t want a weapon, but they would be – what they’re basically asking is to be the only non-weapon country in the world that’s enriching uranium. 

And the level at which they enrich it is really not relevant per se because, really, if you have the ability to enrich at 3.67 percent, it only takes a few weeks to get to 20 percent and then 60 percent and then the 80 and 90 percent that you need for a weapon. 

And so that really is the path forward here.  Iran simply needs to say we’ve agreed to no longer enrich, we’re going to have reactors because we want nuclear energy, and we’re going to import enriched uranium.  This is an opportunity for them if they take it.  This is – and this is the best opportunity they’re going to have.  President Trump is a president of peace.  He doesn’t want a war.  He doesn’t want conflict.  None of us do.  And there’s a path forward here.  But what cannot happen is to live in a world where Iran has a nuclear weapon.

QUESTION:  There’s a path forward.  The path forward has been given to them.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It has.

QUESTION:  And now it’s a matter of whether or not they’re going to take it.  And the President was very, very clear he would lead the effort to stop them from ever achieving that nuclear weapon.  And that would mean – that statement was obvious in terms of that he would use military force to destroy those facilities.  We have the capacity, obviously, to do it.

But back to this question:  Would we need American inspectors and American scientists to shut it down, and would that have to be part of the deal, and anywhere anyplace anytime American inspectors?  Would they have to agree to that in your mind?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I think you would have to allow Americans as part of – you can send – maybe there’ll be French inspectors, there’ll be Italian inspectors, there’ll be Saudis, whoever.  But I think you cannot basically say we will not allow any Americans.

You also have to make sure – if you really want to prevent a nuclear program, okay, and you’re not building a nuclear weapon, then you should open all your facilities.  One of the failures of the Biden – I’m sorry – of the Obama nuclear deal with Iran is that you could not inspect military sites.  Well, if you’re making nuclear weapons, you would probably make them on a military site.  And by the way, it’s been known and discovered that in the past Iran has had a secret nuclear program that it did not disclose to the world.

So I think if in fact – Iran likes to say they’re not interested in nuclear weapons.  They like to say all they want is peaceful nuclear energy.  Then they should not be afraid of inspections by inspectors of any kind, including Americans.

And look, there’s a win here for Iran, okay?  They can actually have real economic development, can have real investment in their country, but they have to walk away from sponsoring terrorists, they have to walk away from helping the Houthis, they have to walk away from building long-range missiles that have no purpose to exist other than having nuclear weapons, and they have to walk away from enrichment. 

These are not unreasonable requests.  There are countries all over the world that have nuclear energy and don’t enrich and don’t have long-range missiles and don’t sponsor terrorism.  That path is there for them.  It’s the path of peace.  And frankly, I pray and hope, and we’ll do everything we can to help convince them that they should take it. 

QUESTION:  I have the same prayer that you do.  And they know what the consequences will be, and they will probably lose their nuclear sites, they’ll lose their refineries.  And if that’s the case, that would probably result in poverty and regime change. 

Last question, China.  You’re right.  I view them, as you do, as our top geopolitical foe.  Things seem to be heated in public.  Are there any things going on behind the scenes that give you some hope that hopefully, for example, on trade and tariffs we can come to some type of agreement?  Because they put tariffs on basically every American product and it’s just – they’ve been ripping us off forever.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  They have.  They’ve been ripping off the world.  And look, yes, there’s efforts.  You can see that, look, this is hurting the Chinese economy.  People forget that the factories where all these shoes and shirts and clothing and all that stuff that comes from China, those are all Chinese jobs.  When they say that the containers, that the factories are not going to be sending things to America, that means they’re out of a job.  This is hurting the Chinese economy badly.

I think there’s two questions.  Can we reach some sort of short-term accommodation with them?  That’s what they want.  I mean, the Chinese are reaching out.  They want to meet.  They want to talk.  We’ve got people involved in that.  Obviously, our Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is involved in those efforts and their talks will come up soon. 

But I think there’s a broader question, and that is whether we shouldn’t – this is a wakeup call that we truly need to become a country that can make more things in America and not be as dependent on China.  We were far too dependent on China.  We allowed them through unfair trade practices to de-industrialize us and to use not just tariffs but non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, dumping.  We’ve allowed them to use all of those things to —

QUESTION:  Intellectual property theft.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  And stealing intellectual property, and really left us de-industrialized as a country and heavily dependent on them.  That’s a very dangerous place to be, and President Trump is taking it on, and he’s doing it now because it needs to be done now.  It cannot wait any longer.  Two more years in this direction and we are going to be in a lot of trouble, really dependent on China.  So I do think there’s this broader question about how much we should buy from them at all moving forward.

QUESTION:  Well, Godspeed, Mr. Secretary.  These are consequential and transformational times, and you’re right in the middle of all of it.  And we wish you the best for the sake of the world, and I hope some of these people understand the seriousness of the President.  Sometimes they might underestimate him.

Mr. Secretary, thank you."
270425,Secretary of State Marco Rubio With Kristen Welker of NBC Meet the Press,"QUESTION:  All right, Mr. Secretary, let’s turn to China and the President’s trade war.  President Trump said he has spoken directly with President Xi Jinping.  Chinese officials, though, say that no talks have taken place about a trade war.  Can you help us to understand where this stands?  Has President Trump spoken to President Xi after imposing those 145 percent tariffs? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I mean, just like the previous answer, I think I’m not going to be commenting on who talked to who and what they talked about, because obviously this is also a high-stakes negotiation.  The fundamental fact is this:  For 30-something years, the Chinese have gotten away with unfair trade practices – not just unfair, outrageously unfair trade practices.

QUESTION:  Yeah.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It’s just very simple.  Chinese companies can do whatever they want in America.  American companies can only do what the Chinese allow them to do in China, and it’s very limited, and every year it gets more and more limited.  They flood not just us but they flood the world with exports, but they push back against any imports.  They are 100 percent favorable to their – unfairly favorable to their companies and unfair to ours.

They steal our intellectual property.  They reverse-engineer things they get ahold of.  I mean, it’s on and on and on unfair, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.  And finally – almost too late, really, but finally – we have a president that stood up to it. 

And it’s not just us that needs to be standing up to it, by the way.  Europe is concerned about the number of electric cars that China tried to dump on them.  China has had trade problems with Canada and with others.  This needs to stop.

So the bottom line is that the President is dealing with something that should have been dealt with a very long time ago, and it was almost too late.

QUESTION:  So, Mr. Secretary, just to be clear, you can’t confirm that a phone call has taken place between President Trump and President Xi of China post the —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I don’t comment on the phone calls the President makes —

QUESTION:  Okay.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — with foreign leaders.

QUESTION:  All right.  Sorry.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, I think I’d direct you to the White House.

QUESTION:  Okay.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It’s for the President to tell you who he’s talked to.  I’m not going to get in the way of those negotiations."
170425,"Department Press Briefing – April 17, 2025","Moreover, we can confirm the reporting that Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd. is directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests. Their actions and Beijing’s support of the company, even after our private engagements with them, is yet another example of China’s empty claims to support peace. We urge our partners to judge the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese companies on their actions, not their empty words. Restoring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea is a priority to President Trump. Beijing should take this priority seriously when considering any future support of CGSTL. The United States will not tolerate anyone providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis.

Now, as part of President Trump’s unwavering defense of free speech, Secretary Rubio has permanently shut down the State Department’s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference office – formerly the Global Engagement Center. As Secretary Rubio stated, “Over the past half decade, [the] bodies like GEC [have called] by our own governing ruling class, nearly destroyed America’s long free speech history.” We have launched a sweeping transparency initiative. The American people deserve answers, and we intend to deliver them. Most of you will recall, of course, the effort to censor Americans using certain entities here in the government, including that one here at the State Department.

QUESTION: China. You probably have heard President Zelenskyy’s latest statement on China, saying that China supplies Russia with manpower, gun power, and even helps them to manufacture some weapons inside Russia. This sort of goes back to your earlier statement a couple of days ago about China providing nearly 80 percent of dual-use supplies to Russia. There are calls from the Congress, bipartisan calls, urging the administration to come up with sanctions on China. Are you planning to take any action to prevent this from happening?

MS BRUCE: Well, we know, of course – I don’t need to mention the word “tariffs” to everyone, but these are things that are not about punishment of any one nation, but it’s about a fair playing field. And that’s relevant, certainly proving that President Trump not only isn’t shy about engaging with China, he’s not shy about engaging with anyone. And that’s one thing the American people know. And I think also our commentary and the nature of the actions we’re taking in general when it comes to China’s choices have been clear.

One thing I – speaking of China and the nature of what they’re involved in, I will tell you something – it’s a little bit out of the Ukraine region – is that there is a Chinese company providing satellite imagery to the Houthis – the Houthis – and we are aware of those reports. That has been, I think, reported originally perhaps by the Financial Times. But China consistently attempts, as you know, to frame itself as a global peacemaker. And however, it is clear that Beijing and China-based companies provide key economic and technical support to regimes like Russia, North Korea, and Iran and its proxies. The CCP continues to enable these regimes, whether it be through the provision of dual-use items Russia needs to sustain its war in Ukraine, North Korea’s ballistic missile development, or Iran’s support of terrorism across the Middle East.

And just taking you back to my topper bit on Chang Guang, this – it’s a dynamic where it’s clear, as we’re learning, their engagement with war and the suffering of people globally, and of course that remains unacceptable. Beijing’s support, by the way, of that company, the satellite company, even after we’ve engaged in discussions with them about this – the fact that they continue to do this is unacceptable, certainly contradicts their claims of being peace supporters. And we urge our partners to judge the CCP and Chinese companies, again, on their actions and not their words.

QUESTION: Yes, Tammy, thank you for the question. I wanted to ask you, we saw a short time ago today President Zelenskyy speaking with reporters in Kyiv and accusing China of supplying weapons to Russia and saying that he will present detailed evidence next week. Does the U.S. have a similar assessment of China’s role directly in weapons, not just technology but with actual armed support for Russia?

MS BRUCE: Well, the specifics of their support, which I’ve spoken about a great deal when it comes to Russia and this war – as well as, as I’ve mentioned a few times here in this briefing, their support of Iran and particularly the Houthis – I’m not going to get into the specifics of what sectors that is in. But I think we’ve been very clear about our concern regarding China. Yes, ma’am."
160425,Sanctioning a China-Based “Teapot” Refinery to Pressure Iran Further,"The United States is today sanctioning Shandong Shengxing Chemical Co., Ltd, a China-based independent “teapot” refinery, for purchasing more than a billion dollars’ worth of Iranian crude oil. The President is committed to drive Iran’s illicit oil exports, including to China, to zero.

The United States is also imposing sanctions on several companies and vessels involved in facilitating Iranian oil shipments to China as part of Iran’s “shadow” fleet. This is the United States’ second action against an independent China-based teapot refinery since President Trump issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 on February 4, 2025.

All sanctions will be fully enforced under the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign on Iran.

As Long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, the United States will hold both Iran and all its partners in sanctions evasion accountable.

Today’s action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13902, which targets Iran’s petroleum and petrochemical sectors, and marks the sixth round of sanctions targeting Iranian oil sales since the President issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 on February 4, 2025. For more information on today’s actions, please see the Department of the Treasury’s press release"
100425,"Department Press Briefing – April 10, 2025","President Trump has also been very clear on China. China’s decision to retaliate is emblematic of its decades of aggressive and unfair trade policies, and President Trump has taken appropriate action in response, announcing the – that the United States tariff on all goods from China has again increased.

China’s unfair trade practices are hurting not only the United States and our workers, but also market economies around the world. China has actively undermined the world trading order for decades; it is high time to correct that imbalance. President Trump is the first world leader brave enough to do so.

QUESTION: Thank you. So a quick question about a Wall Street Journal report. They’re saying that Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret meeting last December that they were behind a widespread series of cyber attacks on American infrastructure, and they linked the attacks to escalation over Taiwan. I just wanted to ask you if that – if Chinese officials have made any kind of similar statements to this administration or if this administration was briefed on that apparent admission during the transition?

MS BRUCE: That is a good question and we’re going to have to take that away and get that back to you. When I do that, by the way – for people watching – we really actually do get back to the reporters with the answer to their questions. (Laughter.) So that’s a genuine framework we ask."
080425,"Department Press Briefing – April 8, 2025","While in Brussels, Secretary Rubio also met with our Indo-Pacific partners about the threats the Chinese Communist Party poses to our security and prosperity. The region needs to be free from China’s coercive and unfair trade policies. Our security depends on it.

QUESTION: All right. Thank you. On Chinese involvement in Ukraine-Russia war, President Zelenskyy today posted a video suggesting that they captured two of Chinese nationals fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Russia. Does the Secretary have any comment on that? And does it change your view, your position on how to help Ukraine beef up Ukraine’s hand —

MS BRUCE: Yeah.

QUESTION: — now that they’ve been – we know they’re fighting against not but one superpower but —

MS BRUCE: It’s disturbing. It’s disturbing with North Korea participating. It’s disturbing with the Chinese soldiers having been captured. We’re aware of those reports, that Ukraine captured two Chinese citizens fighting on behalf of Russia in Ukraine. China is a major enabler of Russia in the war in Ukraine. China provides nearly 80 percent of the dual-use items Russia needs to sustain the war. Eighty percent comes from China. As President Trump has said, continued cooperation between these two nuclear powers will only further contribute to global instability and make the United States and other countries less safe, less secure, and less prosperous. I think that’s an understatement."

These increasingly frequent and destabilizing activities are raising cross-Strait tensions and put at risk global security and prosperity.

G7 members and the larger international community have an interest in the preservation of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We oppose any unilateral actions to threaten such peace and stability, including by force or coercion.

G7 members continue to encourage the peaceful resolution of issues through constructive cross-Strait dialogue."
010425,Response to China’s Military Exercise Near Taiwan,"Once again, China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk.

310325,Implementing Visa Restrictions under the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act,"Today, I am taking steps to impose additional visa restrictions on Chinese officials determined to be substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan Areas, pursuant to the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018.

For far too long, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has refused to afford U.S. diplomats, journalists, and other international observers access to the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas of China, while China’s diplomats and journalists enjoy broad access in the United States. U.S. diplomats are also unable to provide services to U.S. citizens traveling in Tibet. This lack of reciprocity is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I urge the CCP to immediately address the lack of reciprocity and allow diplomats, among others, unrestricted access to the TAR and other Tibetan areas of China."

MS BRUCE: The Panama Canal, all right.

QUESTION: Yes. Sorry. (Laughter.)

MS BRUCE: No, it’s all right. No, it’s okay. We’re in – we’re here; we’re good.

QUESTION: Okay. Today China’s market regulator said it will carry out an antitrust review on the Hong Kong’s CK Hutchinson’s proposed sale of two Panama ports to BlackRock to, as Beijing said, protect fair competition and safeguard public interests. What is the U.S. response to that move by Beijing? And what’s your message to Panama, which has an audit pending over the company’s concessions to operate those ports?

MS BRUCE: All righty, so we are aware of the comments made by China. It’s also no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports at Balboa and Cristóbal at either end of the Panama Canal. So we would refer you to BlackRock and CK Hutchison for more information about the agreement itself, and we refer you to the Government of Panama regarding its role in ensuring that the sale complies with Panamanian laws and regulations.

So yes, we’re aware and it’s not a surprise, certainly."
210325,"Department Press Briefing – March 21, 2025","In addition, for the first time, the United States is sanctioning a so-called “teapot” refinery in China for purchasing millions of barrels of oil worth approximately half a billion dollars.  We are also sanctioning several additional entities and vessels in Iran’s shadow fleet for shipping millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China.  Iran’s behavior across the globe threatens U.S. national security interests.  President Trump has reimposed a maximum pressure campaign designed to end Iran’s nuclear threat, curtail its ballistic missile program, and stop it from supporting terrorist groups.  The maximum pressure campaign is designed to drive Iran’s oil exports, which it uses to fund its destabilizing activities, to zero.  This includes oil exports to China.

QUESTION:  Hi.  Thank you, Tammy.  You got questions about this on Monday.  It will have been almost a week since there was the announcement about termination of funds to USAGM broadcasters such as Voice of America and other grantees.  As a senator, Secretary Rubio was supportive of the U.S. grantee broadcaster Radio Free Asia.  He protected it from cutbacks in the past.  Does he want to revive the funding for Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts into countries like China, Cambodia, and Vietnam?  And is he aware that due to the funding termination, a number of the journalists who work for Radio Free Asia are potentially facing – could face deportation back to countries like China and Vietnam, where they may face imprisonment as a consequence of the reporting work that they’ve done for the U.S. Government by working for this outlet?  And the same goes for Voice of America journalists who also risk deportation back to countries such as Russia, Myanmar, Belarus, China, and Vietnam.  Do you have a comment?

MS BRUCE:  Well, I did have that question, and I have the question out to the Secretary.  It’s something that I’m following up with as well.  It has been a story, understandably.  You’re interested in the answers to this, so I’m going directly to him.  It’s a – it’s – he’s a busy guy, but as – I’m going to continue to look for that from him.  What I can tell you also, though, is that we’re reducing, clearly – he was elected in large part to reduce the federal bureaucracy, right? It’s about waste and fraud, mismanagement.  This is something that has to occur, and in any dynamic there’s going to be actions and tough decisions that have to be made.  It’s – many of us personally also have to go through that when you’re looking at a budget. 

The President continues to take action to ensure the whole of the United States Government, including Executive Branch agencies, are in line with the administration’s policy priorities.  And I’ve said before, I have to keep saying, is that many, many things are fluid, and it’s why – it’s good – why you’re here and why now we’re doing this three days a week, but also when we address the issue, as I asked about the issue of visas.  There are people who are reporting certain things, and like in any situation, if you’re in the United States and you are – and you have to leave, you can also apply for asylum.  If you are in a situation where you’re – where you believe your returning to your home country puts you at significant risk, we have, clearly, procedures where you can apply for asylum, and that is – certainly if someone is coming from that workplace or some other situation, that’s something that people can do. 

If you have a visa – and every situation is different.  That’s why we don’t discuss individual visa dynamics.  But if someone is here and it is a work visa and it’s – their employment has ended, there is a period of time – it’s like any other visa dynamic for anyone who holds a visa, and you can learn about that at state.gov.  You can talk to – there’s a whole host of people that can help you.  And if you – I would guess if you’re here on a work visa, that was probably a complicated, semi-complicated procedure, and so you’re aware of these things.  And so this is what is obvious for anyone in this kind of a situation, especially for those worried about the nature of reporting or a dynamic where they’re concerned about returning.  There are options like that, and that, again, is a very basic situation for everyone in that kind of a situation. 

Yes – yes, sir. "
200325,Sanctioning Entities Purchasing and Transporting Iranian Oil to Further Impose Maximum Pressure on Iran,"The U.S. Department of State is today sanctioning Huaying Huizhou Daya Bay Petrochemical Terminal Storage, an oil terminal in China, for buying and storing Iranian crude oil from a sanctioned vessel.

The Department of the Treasury is concurrently sanctioning China-based Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical Co., Ltd., a “teapot” oil refinery, for purchasing and refining hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian crude oil.  This includes oil from vessels linked to Ansarallah (Houthis), a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and the U.S.-designated Iranian Ministry of Defense of Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL).  “Teapot” refiners are private Chinese refineries that are the primary purchasers of Iranian oil.  This will be the United States’ first designation of a teapot refinery.

In addition, the Department of the Treasury is sanctioning 12 entities and one individual, and identifying eight vessels as blocked property for being responsible for shipping millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China.  These vessels—are part of Iran’s “shadow fleet” of tankers that supply teapot refineries, including Luqing Petrochemical.

These sanctions are being imposed pursuant to President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign to drive Iran’s oil exports, including to China, to zero.  China is by far the largest importer of Iranian oil. The Iranian regime uses the revenue it generates from these sales to finance attacks on U.S. allies, support terrorism around the world, and pursue other destabilizing actions.

All these new sanctions will be fully enforced under the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign.  So long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, the United States will hold both Iran and all its sanctions-evading partners accountable."
190325,Secretary of State Marco Rubio with Hugh Hewitt,"QUESTION:  Joined now by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  Mr. Secretary, welcome back.  It’s good to have you.  Congratulations on assuming the top – the seventh floor.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  It’s – I think we’re starting our tenth week or our ninth week.  I’ve lost count at this point, but a lot has happened in that period of time.  But it’s a great honor to be able to do this and to work for a president that I think is making history every day.

QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Secretary, you’ve been on this program since 2010, I think probably more than a hundred times, and you may remember my basic worldview is that America’s biggest adversary is China, People’s Republic of China; that General Secretary Xi is a tough, ruthless man.  He’s in an alliance with the fanatics in Iran and they present a real and present danger with us.  Do you share that worldview?  Can a diplomat say that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think it’s certainly the biggest challenge we face.  Look, here’s the way I characterize it, because you’re right, I mean, we need to have relations with these countries.  But I think the story of the 21st century is going to be about what happened between the U.S. and China.  I think I said this during my confirmation hearing.  I think the Chinese believe that they are on a path towards becoming the most powerful nation on Earth, that it’s inevitable, it’s just a matter of time, and they seek to manage that rise in a way that – and avoid disruptions along the way if possible.

And look, if in fact they end up out-competing us, out-innovating us, outworking us, what have you, that’s one thing.  But for us to sort of unilaterally allow them to do that rise while not playing by the same rules, then that would be on us.  I think that’s what’s happened for the better part of 20 years.  There was this assumption that some made that if – that we should allow China to continue to cheat in rules of trade and commerce and intellectual property and that kind of thing, and if we let them do it, that eventually they’d become rich, and when they became rich they’d become just like us.  Well, that’s not what happened.  They became rich, but they’re not just like us.

So I would say they’re a rich and powerful country.  They’re going to be a rich and powerful country.  We need to engage with them because it’s irresponsible not to, but we also don’t want to live in a world where we depend on China for things that we need.

QUESTION:  Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that General Secretary Xi is upset about the deal you made in Panama about the canal, and today it was announced that Hong Kong Enterprise is going to delay opening a car plant in Mexico in retaliation for the attempt to get the canal back.  Do you care?  Are we going to get the canal control back in American hands?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, look, we didn’t give the canal to China, as the President says.  President Trump’s been very clear:  We built that canal, we turned it over to – he didn’t agree with that decision, but we turned it over to Panama.  We wake up one day and Chinese influence is all over the canal.  They – Hong Kong-based companies, which obviously have to respond to Chinese law, control all the key ports on – the key ports on both sides, the infrastructure deeply ingrained there benefited the Chinese, and that’s just not sustainable and it can’t continue.  We made our view very clear that we believe the treaty has been violated.  We had a great visit.  There’s a lot of follow-up to be done, but the President has been abundantly clear about it, and that is that the Panama Canal cannot be an outpost for the Chinese, because we built it and we intend to have influence over it, and because we didn’t turn it – like I said, we didn’t turn it over to the Chinese.  We turned it over to Panama, and that’s not the way it’s played out.

QUESTION:  So it’s obviously a flashpoint.  Flashpoints are best discussed at a summit.  Is there a summit in the offing between President Trump and General Secretary Xi, either here or there?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that meeting is eventually going to happen.  There isn’t one scheduled.  I think that time will come.  Obviously, as you know – and you’ve followed these things for a long time – and there needs to be a reason behind it.  It has to – we have to know what they’re meeting about and what the result of the meeting is going to be.  But there’s no doubt that that will happen.  The President has in his first term – he’ll do it again now – I mean, he’ll meet with any foreign leader, basically, if there’s a good reason to do so.  He’s – and look, I think that meeting will happen.  But there’s none scheduled at this moment.

QUESTION:  Now, when the President talked to me – it was President-elect last, in January – and we talked about Jimmy Lai, and he told me he would get Jimmy Lai out of jail.  Have you had any conversations with your Chinese counterparts about getting Mr. Lai out of jail?  Because he’s going to die pretty soon unless we get him out of that Hong Kong prison.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, it’s a priority.  We’ve raised it in every possible form and they know that it’s important to us, and I think there are other countries as well that are very involved in raising this issue.  And that needs to happen, and we’re going to continue to raise it.  Obviously, with some of these things you want to be careful what we say in the media.  We don’t want to jeopardize any efforts.  But I think it’s important to know that it’s not something we’ve forgotten about and that it remains a priority, and I think other countries around the world are making the same point as well to the Chinese.

QUESTION:  Very good.  Now, the Iranian fanatics sell a lot of oil to China.  That’s the connection.  I want to move to the attack on the Houthis this weekend.  First of all, have the Houthis attacked us, or are they just putting out press releases over the last three days?  Because they put out a lot of press releases that they’re shooting at the Truman, and I understood Trump to say if they did that, the bombs would fall on Iran.  What is the situation, Mr. Rubio?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, they’ve – look, they’ve – they say they attack.  I mean, they launch and then they get shot down 100 miles away before it even is a threat, so DOD’s had no problem defending.  They’re certainly not doing right now what they were doing at the peak of this thing, when they were attacking our Navy 150 times and global shipping 170 times.  Maybe I got those numbers inverted, but nonetheless unacceptable."
140325,Announcement of a Visa Restriction Policy to Address the Forced Return of Uyghurs and Members of Other Ethnic or Religious Groups with Protection Concerns to China,"Today, I am announcing a new visa restriction policy that will apply to current or former foreign government officials responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return of Uyghurs or members of other ethnic or religious groups with protection concerns to China. We are committed to combating China’s efforts to pressure governments to forcibly return Uyghurs and other groups to China, where they are subject to torture and enforced disappearances.

I am immediately implementing this policy by taking steps to impose visa restrictions on current and former officials from the Government of Thailand responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return of 40 Uyghurs from Thailand on February 27.

In light of China’s longstanding acts of genocide and crimes against humanity committed against Uyghurs, we call on governments around the world not to forcibly return Uyghurs and other groups to China.

This visa restriction policy is pursuant to Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and allows the Department of State to pursue visa restrictions for current or former foreign government officials who are responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return to China of Uyghurs or members of other ethnic or religious groups with protection concerns. Certain family members of such persons may also be subject to these restrictions."
050325,Justice Department Charges 12 Chinese Contract Hackers and Law Enforcement Officers in Global Computer Intrusion Campaigns,"Chinese Law Enforcement and Intelligence Services Leveraged China’s Reckless and Indiscriminate Hacker-for-Hire Ecosystem, Including the ‘APT 27’ Group, to Suppress Free Speech and Dissent Globally and to Steal Data from Numerous Organizations Worldwide,
Note: View the indictments in U.S. v. Wu Haibo et al., U.S. v. Yin Kecheng, U.S. v. Zhou Shuai et al. here.

The Justice Department, FBI, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and Departments of State and the Treasury announced today their coordinated efforts to disrupt and deter the malicious cyber activities of 12 Chinese nationals, including two officers of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Ministry of Public Security (MPS), employees of an ostensibly private PRC company, Anxun Information Technology Co. Ltd. (安洵信息技术有限公司) also known as “i-Soon,” and members of Advanced Persistent Threat 27 (APT27).

These malicious cyber actors, acting as freelancers or as employees of i-Soon, conducted computer intrusions at the direction of the PRC’s MPS and Ministry of State Security (MSS) and on their own initiative. The MPS and MSS paid handsomely for stolen data. Victims include U.S.-based critics and dissidents of the PRC, a large religious organization in the United States, the foreign ministries of multiple governments in Asia, and U.S. federal and state government agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) in late 2024.

“The Department of Justice will relentlessly pursue those who threaten our cybersecurity by stealing from our government and our people,” said Sue J. Bai, head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. “Today, we are exposing the Chinese government agents directing and fostering indiscriminate and reckless attacks against computers and networks worldwide, as well as the enabling companies and individual hackers that they have unleashed. We will continue to fight to dismantle this ecosystem of cyber mercenaries and protect our national security.”

“The FBI is committed to protecting Americans from foreign cyber-attacks,” said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “Today’s announcements reveal that the Chinese Ministry of Public Security has been paying hackers-for-hire to inflict digital harm on Americans who criticize the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). To those victims who bravely came forward with evidence of intrusions, we thank you for standing tall and defending our democracy. And to those who choose to aid the CCP in its unlawful cyber activities, these charges should demonstrate that we will use all available tools to identify you, indict you, and expose your malicious activity for all the world to see.”

According to court documents, the MPS and MSS employed an extensive network of private companies and contractors in China to hack and steal information in a manner that obscured the PRC government’s involvement. In some cases, the MPS and MSS paid private hackers in China to exploit specific victims. In many other cases, the hackers targeted victims speculatively. Operating from their safe haven and motivated by profit, this network of private companies and contractors in China cast a wide net to identify vulnerable computers, exploit those computers, and then identify information that it could sell directly or indirectly to the PRC government. The result of this largely indiscriminate approach was more worldwide computer intrusion victims, more systems worldwide left vulnerable to future exploitation by third parties, and more stolen information, often of no interest to the PRC government and, therefore, sold to other third-parties. Additional information regarding the indictments and the PRC’s hacker-for-hire ecosystem is available in Public Service Announcements published by the FBI today.

U.S. v. Wu Haibo et al., Southern District of New York

Today, a federal court in Manhattan unsealed an indictment charging eight i-Soon employees and two MPS officers for their involvement, from at least in or around 2016 through in or around 2023, in the numerous and widespread hacking of email accounts, cell phones, servers, and websites. The Department also announced today the court-authorized seizure of the primary internet domain used by i-Soon to advertise its business.

“State-sponsored hacking is an acute threat to our community and national security,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky for the Southern District of New York. “For years, these 10 defendants — two of whom we allege are PRC officials — used sophisticated hacking techniques to target religious organizations, journalists, and government agencies, all to gather sensitive information for the use of the PRC. These charges will help stop these state-sponsored hackers and protect our national security. The career prosecutors of this office and our law enforcement partners will continue to uncover alleged state-sponsored hacking schemes, disrupt them, and bring those responsible to justice.”

The defendants remain at large and wanted by the FBI. Concurrent with today’s announcement,  the U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of any person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, engages in certain malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The reward is offered for the following individuals who are alleged to have worked in various capacities to direct or carry out i-Soon’s malicious cyber activity:

Wu Haibo (吴海波), Chief Executive Officer
Chen Cheng (陈诚), Chief Operating Officer
Wang Zhe (王哲), Sales Director
Liang Guodong (梁国栋), Technical Staff
Ma Li (马丽), Technical Staff
Wang Yan (王堰), Technical Staff
Xu Liang (徐梁), Technical Staff
Zhou Weiwei (周伟伟), Technical Staff
Wang Liyu (王立宇), MPS Officer
Sheng Jing (盛晶), MPS Officer
i-Soon and its employees, to include the defendants, generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue as a key player in the PRC’s hacker-for-hire ecosystem. In some instances, i-Soon conducted computer intrusions at the request of the MSS or MPS, including cyber-enabled transnational repression at the direction of the MPS officer defendants. In other instances, i-Soon conducted computer intrusions on its own initiative and then sold, or attempted to sell, the stolen data to at least 43 different bureaus of the MSS or MPS in at least 31 separate provinces and municipalities in China. i-Soon charged the MSS and MPS between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully exploited. i-Soon also trained MPS employees how to hack independently of i-Soon and offered a variety of hacking methods for sale to its customers.

The defendants’ U.S.-located targets included a large religious organization that previously sent missionaries to China and was openly critical of the PRC government and an organization focused on promoting human rights and religious freedom in China. In addition, the defendants targeted multiple news organizations in the United States, including those that have opposed the CCP or delivered uncensored news to audiences in Asia, including China and the New York State Assembly, one of whose representatives had communicated with members of a religious organization banned in China.

The defendants’ foreign-located targets included a religious leader and his office, and a Hong Kong newspaper that i-Soon considered as being opposed to the PRC government. The defendants also targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea, and Indonesia.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ryan B. Finkel, Steven J. Kochevar, and Kevin Mead for the Southern District of New York and Trial Attorney Gregory J. Nicosia Jr. of the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case.

U.S. v. Yin Kecheng and U.S. v. Zhou Shuai et al., District of Columbia

Today, a federal court unsealed two indictments charging APT27 actors Yin Kecheng (尹可成) and Zhou Shuai (周帅) also known as “Coldface” for their involvement in the multi-year, for-profit computer intrusion campaigns dating back, in the case of Yin, to 2013. The Department also announced today court-authorized seizures of internet domains and computer server accounts used by Yin and Zhou to facilitate their hacking activity.

The defendants remain at large. View the FBI’s Wanted posters for Shuai and Kecheng here.

Concurrent with today’s announcement, the Department of States State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs is announcing two reward offers under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP) of up to $2 million each for information leading to the arrests and convictions, in any country, of malicious cyber actors Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, both Chinese nationals residing in China.

“These indictments and actions show this office’s long-standing commitment to vigorously investigate and hold accountable Chinese hackers and data brokers who endanger U.S. national security and other victims across the globe,” said Interim U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. for the District of Columbia. “The defendants in these cases have been hacking for the Chinese government for years, and these indictments lay out the strong evidence showing their criminal wrongdoing. We again demand that the Chinese government to put a stop to these brazen cyber criminals who are targeting victims across the globe and then monetizing the data they have stolen by selling it across China.”

The APT27 group to which Yin and Zhou belong is also known to private sector security researchers as “Threat Group 3390,” “Bronze Union,” “Emissary Panda,” “Lucky Mouse,” “Iron Tiger,” “UTA0178,” “UNC 5221,” and “Silk Typhoon.” As alleged in court documents, between August 2013 and December 2024, Yin, Zhou, and their co-conspirators exploited vulnerabilities in victim networks, conducted reconnaissance once inside those networks, and installed malware, such as PlugX malware, that provided persistent access. The defendants and their co-conspirators then identified and stole data from the compromised networks by exfiltrating it to servers under their control. Next, they brokered stolen data for sale and provided it to various customers, only some of whom had connections to the PRC government and military. For example, Zhou sold data stolen by Yin through i-Soon, whose primary customers, as noted above, were PRC government agencies, including the MSS and the MPS.

The defendants’ motivations were financial and, because they were profit-driven, they targeted broadly, rendering victim systems vulnerable well beyond their pilfering of data and other information that they could sell. Between them, Yin and Zhou sought to profit from the hacking of numerous U.S.-based technology companies, think tanks, law firms, defense contractors, local governments, health care systems, and universities, leaving behind them a wake of millions of dollars in damages.

The documents related to the seizure warrants, also unsealed today, further allege that Yin and Zhou continued to engage in hacking activity, including Yin’s involvement in the recently announced hack of Treasury between approximately September and December 2024. Virtual private servers used to conduct the Treasury intrusion belonged to, and were controlled by, an account that Yin and his co-conspirators established. Yin and his co-conspirators used that same account and other linked accounts they controlled to lease servers used for additional malicious cyber activity. The seizure warrant unsealed today allowed the FBI to seize the virtual private servers and other infrastructure used by the defendants to perpetrate these crimes.

On Jan. 17, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions against Yin for his role in hacking that agency between September and December 2024. Concurrent with today’s indictments, OFAC also announced sanctions on Zhou and Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company Ltd., a company operated by Zhou for purposes of his hacking activity.

Private sector partners are also taking voluntary actions to raise awareness and strengthen defenses against the PRC’s malicious cyber activity. Today, Microsoft published research that highlights its unique, updated insights into Silk Typhoon tactics, techniques, and procedures specifically its targeting of the IT supply chain.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jack F. Korba and Tejpal S. Chawla for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Tanner Kroeger of the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case.

***

The above disruptive actions targeting PRC malicious cyber activities were the result of investigations conducted by FBI New York and Washington Field Offices, FBI Cyber Division, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Southern District of New York and District of Columbia and the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case.

The Department acknowledges the value of public-private partnerships in combating advanced cyber threats and recognizes Microsoft, Volexity, PwC, and Mandiant for their valuable assistance in these investigations.

The details in the above-described indictments and warrants are merely allegations. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."
050325,Zhou Shuai,"Zhou Shuai is identified as allegedly associated with an advanced persistent threat group (APT27), who are also known to private sector security researchers as “Threat Group 3390,” “Bronze Union,” “Emissary Panda,” “Lucky Mouse,” and “Iron Tiger,” “UTA0178,” “UNC 5221,” and “Silk Typhoon.”  Zhou is a longtime participant within the Chinese hacking eco-system, enriching himself financially as a hacker for hire and data broker for a myriad of Chinese entities.

Zhou’s alleged participation in the Chinese hacking eco-system dates back to the late 1990’s.  He is the owner of 上海黑英信息技术有限公司, a/k/a Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company, which he established in or around 2010.  Since that time, Shanghai Heiying employed a cadre of Chinese Nationals known to conduct Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) activity world-wide.  Zhou is also known to have extensive contacts within the Chinese hacking eco-system and the Chinese government.

An FBI investigation of APT27, which began in approximately 2014, resulted in two separate indictments in the District of Columbia.  Zhou was charged in the second indictment with a conspiracy related to computer network intrusion activity occurring from roughly 2018 to 2020.  Zhou is charged with wire fraud, money laundering, aggravated identity theft, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

The U.S. Department of State is offering a REWARD OF UP TO $2 MILLION for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Zhou Shuai.

050325,Sanctions on China-Based Hacker and Data Broker,"The Department of Justice today unsealed indictments charging Zhou Shuai and Yin Kecheng, eight employees of i-Soon, a Chinese technology company, and two officers of China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) with a variety of hacking-related offenses.  Further, the Diplomatic Security Service’s Rewards for Justice Program (RFJ) is offering up to $10 million for information on i-Soon, its employees, and the MPS officers engaged in malicious cyber activities highlighted in the Department of Justice’s indictments.

Additionally, the United States imposed sanctions on the Shanghai-based malicious cyber actor and data broker, Zhou Shuai, and his company, Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company.  Zhou Shuai illegally acquired, brokered, and sold data from highly sensitive U.S. critical infrastructure networks, including in the defense industrial base, communications, health, and government sectors.  The Department of State also announced reward offers under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP) of up to $2 million each for information leading to the arrests and/or convictions of Zhou Shuai and Yin Kecheng.

As evidenced by today’s, and previous announcements, China offers safe harbor for private sector companies that conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States and its partners.  The Chinese Communist Party also appears to contract them with varying degrees of control and effectiveness.  China-backed malicious cyber actors continue to be one of the greatest and most persistent threats to U.S. national security. 

Today’s multi-agency effort reflects our whole-of-government approach to protecting and defending against China-based cyber threats to Americans, their sensitive personal data, and our critical systems.  President Trump is committed to protecting the American people and U.S. critical infrastructure from these pervasive threats, and we will resolutely use all the tools at our disposal to do so.

The Department of the Treasury sanctions actions today on Zhou Shuai, and his company Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company Limited (Shanghai Heiying) were taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended.  For more information, see Treasury’s press release, DOJ’s press release, the TOCRP announcement, and RFJ’s announcement."
270225,On Thailand’s Forced Return of Uyghurs to China,"We condemn in the strongest possible terms Thailand’s forced return of at least 40 Uyghurs to China, where they lack due process rights and where Uyghurs have faced persecution, forced labor, and torture. As Thailand’s longstanding ally, we are alarmed by this action, which risks running afoul of its international obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture and the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. This act runs counter to the Thai people’s longstanding tradition of protection for the most vulnerable and is inconsistent with Thailand’s commitment to protect human rights. We urge all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China.

China, under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party, has committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. We call on Chinese authorities to provide full access to verify the well-being of the returned Uyghurs on a regular basis. The Thai Government must insist and fully verify continuously that Chinese authorities protect the Uyghurs’ human rights.

260225,New Sanctions Increase Pressure on Iran’s UAV and Ballistic Missile Programs,"The United States is today sanctioning six entities based in the People’s Republic of China, including Hong Kong, that have been involved in the procurement of key components by entities connected to Iran’s UAV and ballistic missile programs.

Today’s action, which is part of President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign on the Iranian regime, aims to disrupt efforts by the Iranian entity Pishtazan Kavosh Gostar Boshra (PKGB) to reconstitute its procurement network and continue obtaining critical parts from foreign suppliers.

The United States will use all available means to expose and disrupt Iran’s growing UAV and missile development and proliferation, which destabilizes the Middle East and beyond. We will continue to act against the complex schemes Iran employs to conceal its acquisition of sensitive technology for its missile and UAV programs. These programs produce missiles and drones that Iran uses against our allies and exports to its terror proxy groups and Russia.

The Department of the Treasury’s action was taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their supporters. See Treasury’s Press Release."
190225,U.S. Support for the Philippines in the South China Sea,"The United States stands with its ally the Philippines to condemn the unsafe and irresponsible actions by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army-Navy (PLAN) to interfere with a Philippine maritime air operation in the vicinity of Scarborough Reef.  A Chinese helicopter came within three meters of a Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Resources plane conducting routine overflight, endangering the safety of the aircraft and its crew.  This incident follows China’s separate unsafe and unprofessional maneuver on February 11 that endangered an Australian aircraft that was conducting a routine maritime patrol in the South China Sea.

Reckless Chinese actions such as these are a threat to navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, and we will continue to support our allies and partners to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. We call on China to refrain from coercive actions and settle its disputes peacefully in accordance with international law.

The 1951 United States-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty extends to armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft – including those of its Coast Guard – anywhere in the South China Sea."
300125,Secretary Marco Rubio with Megyn Kelly of The Megyn Kelly Show,"QUESTION:  It’s such a tricky time to be Secretary of State, especially as a Republican, because you look at the Republican Party and it’s fractured internally about where we should be on foreign policy.  It’s not like during the Bush years, where it was – were much more neocon-y on the right, and now there’s a real division within the right, within MAGA even, on how – what should we do about Ukraine, as most of the party I think wants nothing to do with that anymore; how – what kind of saber-rattling should we do – be doing about Iran.  There’s a large strain that believes none, we should be focused on China and we should stop demonizing Iran and Russia and keep our eye on our biggest threat.  I know you think they’re our biggest threat as well.  So how – just give me the 30,000-foot-level view of how you’re going to navigate that fracture. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  Well, I think we spend a lot of time in American politics debating tactics, like what we’re going to do, who we’re going to sanction, what letter we’re going to send or whatever.  I think it really has to start with strategy:  What is the strategic objective?  What’s the purpose, the mission?  And I think the mission of American foreign policy – and this may sound sort of obvious, but I think it’s been lost.  The interest of American foreign policy is to further the national interest of the United States of America, right?  I mean, every — 

QUESTION:  America first. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, and that’s the way the world has always worked.  The way the world has always worked is that the Chinese will do what’s in the best interests of China, the Russians will do what’s in the best interest of Russia, the Chileans are going to do what’s in the best interest of Chile, and the United States needs to do what’s in the best interest of the United States.  Where our interests align, that’s where you have partnerships and alliances; where our differences are not aligned, that is where the job of diplomacy is to prevent conflict while still furthering our national interests and understanding they’re going to further theirs.  And that’s been lost. 

And I think that was lost at the end of the Cold War, because we were the only power in the world, and so we assumed this responsibility of sort of becoming the global government in many cases, trying to solve every problem.  And there are terrible things happening in the world.  There are.  And then there are things that are terrible that impact our national interest directly, and we need to prioritize those again.  So it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power.  That was not – that was an anomaly.  It was a product of the end of the Cold War, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet.  We face that now with China and to some extent Russia, and then you have rogue states like Iran and North Korea you have to deal with.   

QUESTION:  The New York Times said okay, you guys got away with this with Colombia, but you’re not going to be able to pull that trick with Russia, with China, with Iran.  If you try to sort of bully these stronger nations in this way, it’s not going to go very well.  Is that a fair point?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’re not interested in bullying anybody and we don’t feel like we bullied Colombia.  We feel like we had a deal.  Colombia signed a deal.  They signed a piece of paper that said yes, send us these airplanes, and then halfway into the flight they broke it.  And so our answer was, well, now we flew these planes, we had to bring them back to the United States, so now you’re going to come pick them up.  Why are we going to pay for those flights because you canceled them?  It’s not bullying.  It’s they broke a contract that we had made with them. 

Obviously, look, China has nuclear weapons.  They’re tough people.  There’s no doubt about it.  They’re a tough people, they have nuclear weapons, they’re a great power with a large economy – they’re going to be a global power.  But it can’t come at our expense.  And so ultimately when you’re dealing with great powers like China, it’s going to be at the highest levels of their president and ours or their premier and ours – and our president, and that interaction will happen.  In the case of Russia, the same.  Obviously, there’s going to be – whatever happens with Russia will be a Putin-Trump dynamic.   

But I think most certainly, sure, I mean, the world is – the way you treat – not the way you treat countries, but the way you approach a nation has to be based on the strategic balance.  But I don’t view that we bullied Colombia, nor do I think these articles about oh, they’re going to turn to China – that’s absurd.  That’s an absurd argument.  I think the overwhelming majority of people in Colombia, a country I know very well, don’t even like their president.  I mean, this guy had an election today, he’d lose.   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  So I don’t pay a lot of – most of the people, unfortunately, that opine on – the more I have been delved into foreign policy and the more I read people who claim to know about foreign policy, the more I realize that a lot of the people we believe are experts have no idea what they’re talking about. 

QUESTION:  There’s a large delta.  What about – you mentioned China.  Did you recently have a call with the – their – the foreign minister?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  The foreign minister. 

QUESTION:  And there was a report that you were – you received a sort of warning that you needed to basically watch —  

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, somebody told me that.  And that’s – so two things that – the game that they play.  Number one is they put out an English translation and they put out a Chinese translation, and they don’t always overlap.  The call was very straightforward, and I basically said you’re acting in the best interest of China, we’re going to act in the best interest of America.  We’re two great powers.  And in areas where we can work together, there’s probably no problem in the world we couldn’t solve working together; in areas where we have disagreements, we have a responsibility to manage it so it doesn’t escalate into something catastrophic.  But be clear that we’re going to do these things. 

I did not – at least the translator that was on the call did not say anything to me that I felt was over the top.  But then they put out these games.  They like to play these games.  They put out these translations where it says one thing in English and then it’s translated in a different – they use a different term in Mandarin – so like he was warned not to overstep himself – they never said that.  And if they had, I would have told them, well, I would say the same to you – don’t overstep either.  And – but that didn’t happen, at least not on the call, or at least maybe their interpreter didn’t want to interpret it that way.   

QUESTION:  Right.   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  But that was not the readout we got.  But it’s silly and irrelevant.  What really matters is the decisions we make moving forward.  And China wants to be the most powerful country in the world and they want to do so at our expense, and that’s not in our national interest, and we’re going to address it.  We don’t want a war over it, but we’re going to address it. 

QUESTION:  Well, that brings us – well, we have more on China, but that brings us to Panama, where you’re about to go.  And China is obviously playing a role down there, is one of the reasons why Trump has been saying – President Trump has been saying we want the canal back; we never intended to give it to the Chinese.  That was never the game plan.  They don’t technically control the Panama Canal, but they do have interests down there.  Can you explain it so people can understand it? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  So, well, they’re all over Panama.  A few years ago, Panama made the decision that they were going to de-recognize Taiwan and align with Beijing.  And with that came all sorts of money that was provided to the then president’s administration to – for projects and things of that nature, but also Chinese investment.  And one of the main investments they have is in these two port facilities on both – on the entry – on both sides of the canal.  And all kinds of other infrastructure, cranes and the like.  And so people will argue, well, that’s not China; that’s a company based in Hong Kong.  Well, a company based in Hong Kong is the Government of China.  You are not a company in China if the Chinese Government doesn’t control you.  It’s similar to the argument about ByteDance and TikTok, which is – every company that operates from China or Hong Kong, which is controlled by China – more than ever controlled by China; it’s no longer autonomous – they have to do whatever the government tells them.  And if the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to.  And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so.  That is a direct threat. 

So it’s a technicality, but in reality if China wanted to obstruct traffic in the Panama Canal, they could.  That’s a fact.  And it’s my view that’s a violation of the treaty agreement, and that’s what President Trump is raising, and we’re going to address that topic.  It’s one of the concerns.  That dynamic cannot continue – not simply because we built it at great cost in lives and treasure, but because it is contrary to our national interest.  It is not in the national interest of the United States to have a canal we paid for and we built used as a leverage and a weapon against us.  That can’t happen. 

QUESTION:  So what’s the solution? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, that’s what we’re going to have to talk about.  And I think the President’s been pretty clear he wants to administer the canal again.  Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea.  But we’re – that message has been brought very clear.  And there are a lot of other areas we can work very closely with Panama on.  I mean, their government generally is pro-American on a number of fronts.  But this is a core national interest for us.  We can work together on a lot of things, and there are a lot of things we can work with them on that are very positive on migration, and they can be very helpful on all sorts of things.  And I hope we’ll get resolution to those very soon.  But that does not in any way replace the core reality that the Panama Canal, we cannot allow any foreign power – particularly China – to hold that kind of potential control over it that they do.  That just can’t continue. 

QUESTION:  But what could they do?  I mean, there – these Chinese-controlled or Chinese businesses along the canal, they’re very large ones that could easily be turned into military facilities – do they have to get rid of them?  Do they have to – like, what – what are the kinds of things we could ask for that would satisfy us? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Hong Kong-based companies having control over the entry and exit points of the canal is completely unacceptable.  That cannot continue.  Because of the – and if there’s a conflict and China tells them, do everything you can to obstruct the canal so that the U.S. can’t engage in trade and commerce, so that the U.S. military and naval fleet cannot get to the Indo-Pacific fast enough, they would have to do it.  They would have to do it, and they would do it.  And now we’d have a major problem on our hands.  That’s number one. 

Number two, we have to talk about the fact that we built this thing.  We paid for it.  Thousands of people died doing this – Americans.  And somehow our naval vessels who go through there, and American shipping that goes through there, pays rates some cases higher than other countries are paying – for example, a vessel from China.  That’s also not acceptable.  It was a terrible deal when it was made, it should never have been allowed.  They’re going to tell you that it’s set by an independent administrative entity and not the government; that’s their internal problem.  They’ll have to figure that out.  But we should not be in a position of having to pay more than other countries.  In fact, we should be getting a discount or maybe for free, because we paid for the thing. 

QUESTION:  There too, like you mentioned with Colombia, is there a risk if we play too hardball we drag them into the arms of the Chinese? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I would argue that the canal is already in the arms of the Chinese.  So I mean, that’s one aspect I would say.  And we can’t operate that way.  Like, we can’t operate in the world saying, well, we can’t defend our national interests because if not these countries will turn to China against us.  I mean, we wouldn’t allow that to happen.  It would be against our national interests.   

So – but that said, I hope we don’t get to that point, right.  We have a – on so many topics, a very good working relationship with Panama and with their government, and I want that to continue.  But we have a core national interest that’s at stake, they should understand that, and I think that they will understand that, and it needs to be addressed.  And we’ll do that; we’ll do it in the right forum.  We’ll do it appropriately.  I’m not here to – we’re not here to embarrass anyone or cause internal friction or problems for them.  But I can assure you if it was the other way around, and that was a canal that the Chinese had built, they would be very forceful about it.  So we can no longer operate in the world with two hands tied behind our back. 

QUESTION:  People need to understand that Panama is not exactly about Panama; it’s about the Chinese, which you’ve been jumping up and down about for a while, warning that people may not realize just how grave the threat is.  And you said something – I think it was at your confirmation hearing – to the effect of if China gets what it wants, in 10 years or so, life could look very different.  Like it could be dramatic —    

SECRETARY RUBIO: Maybe even faster 

QUESTION:  — for us, for America. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  So, I mean they today control – I mean, we love our technology and we need it for all kinds of advances.  All of that depends on critical minerals, at the end of day – ranging aluminum, cobalt – you name it.  They have gone around the world buying up mining rights, and they control not just the mining of it but the refining and the production of it, and the use of it for industrial purposes.  So you might remember during COVID everybody was freaking out because we couldn’t get the masks because they were all made in China.  And then we couldn’t get this because they were all made in China.  We had lost and given away our industrial capacity.  This is even graver.  This is the rare earth minerals, this is the raw materials necessary for some of the things that go into our most advanced technologies in the defense realm, in medicine.  Eighty-something percent of the active ingredients in generic pharmaceuticals in the United States are made in China.  We can’t make them.   

So if they decide we’re going to cut you off from these things, they – we’d be in a lot of trouble, because we gave away our industrial capacity on those things.  That can’t continue.  That’s a vulnerability that we face.  And they will use it as leverage.  In fact, they are already using it as leverage.  For the first time ever, they have actually imposed export controls on critical minerals to damage the – our national security, but ultimately our technological capacity as well. 

So it ranges topics, but ultimately if China controls the means of production for both raw material and industry, then we’re – they have total leverage on us economically.  And that’s the world we’re headed to.  And I was wrong; maybe not in 10 years.  Maybe in five. 

QUESTION:  So I mean, it’s a dicey situation.  Trump – President Trump knows all this. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yes. 

QUESTION:  And yet one of the top Chinese leaders attended his inauguration.  He understands that there’s – it has to be played very carefully.  We don’t want to make an open, hot-war enemy out of them.  But we’ve been passive for too long. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  First of all, one of the interesting things about President Trump is he’s incredibly accessible.  People don’t believe this, but I mean, if you’re a – if you’re a rank-and-file, not even leadership, member of Congress and you call the President of the United States, the chances are you’re going to get a call back, and you’re going to get a call back from him, and you might get a call back that very day, maybe within an hour or two.  He’s incredibly accessible, to both Americans and also to foreign leaders.  His policy generally has been, I’ll meet with any world leader, I’ll engage with any world leader.  That doesn’t mean just because you’re meeting with him you’re giving anything away, but he’s willing to engage.   

In the case of China, there’s two things.  I just described one, which is the grave threat that they pose to our national interests; and the other is the mature realization that no matter what happens, China is going to be a rich and powerful country.  We are going to have to deal with them.  In fact – and I said this in my call with their foreign minister, but I said this publicly – the future – the history of the 21st century will largely be about what happened between the U.S. and China.  So for us to pretend that somehow we’re not going to engage with them is absurd. 

Now, we should engage on our national interests.  That doesn’t – engagement and concessions are two different things.  What’s been horrifying is that for 25 or 30 years, we’ve treated China as a developing country, and we allowed them to continue to do things that were unfair.  We said, go ahead, let them cheat on trade, let them steal our technology, because when they get rich they’ll become just like us.  They became rich, they did not become like us, and now they want to continue to have these unfair benefits.  That has to stop. 

QUESTION:  And they built up their military. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Their military, their industrial capacity, but all over the world their control of critical minerals.  Again, I go back to them because people don’t think about it.  

QUESTION:  Buying up land in the United States. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Buying up farming land in the United States in particular as well, because they need to produce food, and they want to be able to control that.  They’re doing it because it’s in their national interest.  They are doing, frankly, what I would do – well, maybe not the human rights violations, but they are doing what anyone would do if they were the leader of China.  They are acting in China’s best interests.  What’s been missing is American policies that act in our best interest.  And that needs to return. 

QUESTION:  How does Greenland fit into all of this? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the Arctic, which has gotten very little attention, but the Arctic Circle and the Arctic region is going to become critical for shipping lanes, for how you get some of this energy that’s going to be produced under President Trump – these energies rely on shipping lanes.  The Arctic has some of the most valuable shipping lanes in the world.  As some of the ice is melting, it’s become more and more navigable.  We need to be able to defend that.   

So if you project what the Chinese have done, it is just a matter of time before – because they are not an Arctic power.  They do not have an Arctic presence, so they need to be able to have somewhere that they can stage from.  And it is completely realistic to believe that the Chinese will eventually – maybe even in the short term – try to do in Greenland what they have done at the Panama Canal and in other places, and that is install facilities that give them access to the Arctic with the cover of a Chinese company but that in reality serve a dual purpose: that in a moment of conflict, they could send naval vessels to that facility and operate from there.  And that is completely unacceptable to the national security of the world and to the United – to the security of the world and the national security of the United States.   

So the question becomes:  If the Chinese begin to threaten Greenland, do we really trust that that is not a place where those deals are going to be made?  Do we really trust that that is not a place where they would not intervene, maybe by force?"

Secretary Rubio underscored enduring U.S. commitment to the U.S.-Japan Alliance as the cornerstone of security and prosperity in the region."
200125,Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Fact Sheet,"What Is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act?

The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) is a U.S. law.  It established a rebuttable presumption that goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China or by an entity on the UFLPA Entity List are subject to import under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. § 1307).  The law was enacted on December 23, 2021, and enforcement began on June 21, 2022.

What Is the Purpose of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act?

The UFLPA is one tool the U.S. government uses to prevent goods made with forced labor connected to the XUAR from entering the United States and to further promote accountability for entities responsible for forced labor.

What Is the Impact of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act?

The Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for preventing products made with forced labor from entering into the United States by investigating and acting upon allegations of forced labor in supply chains.  CBP has reviewed thousands of shipments from the electronics, apparel, footwear, pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial, and automotive sectors.  This has resulted in the denial of thousands of shipments including goods made with forced labor, totaling hundreds of millions in U.S. dollars.  It also has resulted in companies conducting due diligence measures to ensure compliance with U.S. laws by tracing their supply chains for potential connections to forced labor.  

What Can You Do?

Governments are encouraged to consider similar prohibitions on the import or sale of goods made with forced labor, including broad prohibitions on goods made where state-imposed forced labor is occurring.

Stakeholders in the trade community should closely examine their supply chains to ensure their goods are not mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, with forced labor in the XUAR or elsewhere, or by entities on the UFLPA Entity List.  

Nongovernmental organizations, diaspora communities and activist groups, and private sector entities can raise awareness about the egregious human rights situation in the XUAR.

The UFLPA Entity List includes: (1) a list of entities in XUAR that mine, produce, or manufacture wholly or in part any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise with forced labor; (2) a list of entities working with the government of XUAR to recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, or receive forced labor or Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, or members of other persecuted groups out of XUAR; (3) a list of entities that exported products mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by entities in lists 1 and 2 from the People’s Republic of China into the United States; and (4) a list of facilities and entities, including the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, that source material from XUAR or from persons working with the government of XUAR or the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for purposes of the “poverty alleviation” program or the “pairing-assistance” program or any other government-labor scheme that uses forced labor."

121224,Country Reports on Terrorism 2023: People’s Republic of China (Hong Kong and Macau),"China

Overview:  The PRC’s counterterrorism efforts continued to target ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang as so-called extremists for engaging in standard practices of Islam.  Beijing considers the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) the primary source of terrorism in Xinjiang.  However, there is no credible evidence that ETIM is an extant organization, and the United States instead assesses that it is a broad label the PRC uses to inaccurately paint a variety of Uyghur actors, including non-violent activists and advocates for human rights, as terrorist threats.

The PRC government’s CT measures have included sprawling detention facilities, known officially as “vocational education and training centers,” in which more than one million people are believed to have been detained since 2017.  Since 2014 the PRC has also prosecuted and imprisoned a large number of Xinjiang residents under its “strike hard” campaign against alleged terrorists and “extremists.”  According to PRC law enforcement reporting, prosecutions continued through 2023.  International media reporting indicated that PRC authorities used opaque prosecutions for terrorism offenses as a quasi-legal mechanism to transfer inmates from “reeducation” camps to prisons, allowing the PRC to shut down some of these camps.  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ August 2022 assessment of Xinjiang stated that the PRC’s imprecise definition of “extremism” and overly broad application of its antiterrorism laws led to a “pattern of large-scale arbitrary detention.”  The PRC denies its Xinjiang policies involve human rights abuses, claiming its system of “reeducation” camps exist to “combat separatism and Islamist militancy in the region.”

Since 1999 the PRC has been designated a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.  It was redesignated a CPC in 2023.

2023 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorist incidents in 2023 in China or that targeted Chinese nationals included the following:

On October 13, in Beijing, a non-PRC citizen stabbed the spouse of an Israeli diplomat working at the Israeli Embassy in Beijing.  The diplomat’s spouse, the only victim in the attack, was seriously injured.  The perpetrator claimed to have targeted the Israeli diplomat because of their nationality.  No group has claimed responsibility for this incident.
On August 13, Chinese engineers were attacked at Gwadar Port in Balochistan, Pakistan.  According to international media reports, the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army claimed credit for the attack.  The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan issued a statement condemning the terrorist act.
Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The PRC continued to advance and defend its counterterrorism policies.  The PRC routinely lobbied foreign partners to extradite alleged extremist Uyghurs and sought public endorsement of its CT efforts in multilateral fora.

Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The PRC is a member of the Financial Action Task Force, the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism.  China’s Financial Intelligence Unit is composed of the PBOC headquarters’ AML Bureau, the China Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Center (or CAMLMAC), PBOC branches’ AML divisions, and the Ministry of Public Security’s local economic crimes bureaus.

In 2021 the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a revised draft anti-money laundering (AML) law for public comment, to prevent and curb money laundering and terrorist financing and to safeguard national security.  According to the State Council’s 2023 legislative workplan, the amended anti-money laundering law was included in a list of 17 draft laws to be reviewed by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.  Updates to the amended AML law reportedly addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets.  As of December 31, the legislation had not been passed.  There were no significant changes in 2023.

Countering Violent Extremism:  The PRC continued to implement broad repressive campaigns in Xinjiang under the guise of countering what it calls “extremism,” including, since 2017, mass “reeducation” and “vocational training” of predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, as well as draconian prison sentences following opaque trials.  Under the pretext of counterterrorism efforts, the PRC used existing domestic laws to actively screen, monitor, and censor its citizens on the internet.

International and Regional Cooperation:  The 2023 China Military Power Report catalogued PRC diplomatic and military outreach in support of its global CT aims, stating that the PRC “is implementing its global counterterrorism strategy through international outreach that spans across diplomatic and military domains to garner the assistance of partner governments to prevent terrorist attacks in China and against Chinese citizens and economic projects abroad.”  The PRC further leveraged involvement in regional security fora, joint border patrols, and international exercises to press its neighbors into adopting its approach to CT operations.

The PRC also continued efforts to promote its Global Security Initiative (GSI) as an alternative approach to pursuing CT cooperation.  In a September 21 speech given at the 13th Ministerial Plenary Meeting of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), Director of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi encouraged the international community to “uphold the GSI’s vision and principles,” adding that “smearing the justified counterterrorism efforts of other countries in the name of human rights, democracy and religion will find no support.”

The PRC is a member of the following organizations:

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum
The East Asia Summit
The GCTF

190924,2024 Fiscal Transparency Report: China,"China

During the review period, the government made its enacted budget and end-of-year report publicly available, including online, but it did not publish an executive budget proposal before enacting the budget. Information on debt obligations was publicly available but was not always complete or updated. Budget documents did not identify financial allocations to or earnings from state-owned enterprises. Not all major state-owned enterprises had publicly available, audited financial statements, and they did not disclose their debt holdings. The supreme audit institution did not meet international standards of independence but reviewed the government’s accounts and made audit reports publicly available within a reasonable period. The government specified in law or regulation, and appeared to follow in practice, the criteria and procedures for awarding natural resource extraction contracts and licenses. Basic information on natural resource extraction awards was publicly available. The sovereign wealth fund had a sound legal framework and disclosed its sources of funding, but not its general approach to withdrawals.

Steps the PRC could take to improve fiscal transparency include:

Providing a substantially complete picture of the government’s revenues and expenditures;
Making its executive budget proposal widely and easily accessible to the public within a reasonable period;
Publishing complete information on debt obligations, including online;
Detailing in budget documents allocations to, earnings from, and debt information of major state-owned enterprises;
Publishing audit reports for major state-owned enterprises;
Ensuring the supreme audit institution meets international standards of independence; and
Disclosing the sovereign wealth fund’s general approach to withdrawals"
060824,2024 END Wildlife Trafficking Report,"Report to Congress on the
Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act
P.L. 114-231; 16 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7644

The Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act (P.L. 114-231; 16 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7644) (the Act) directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, to submit to Congress a report that lists Focus Countries and Countries of Concern, as defined in the Act.

Wildlife trafficking remains a serious transnational crime that threatens security, economic prosperity, the rule of law, long-standing conservation efforts, and human health. E.O. 13773 of February 9, 2017 called for a comprehensive and decisive approach to dismantle organized crime syndicates and specifically recognized the connection between wildlife trafficking and transnational criminal organizations.

The Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking (Task Force), co-chaired by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney General, brings together 17 federal departments and agencies to implement the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking (the “National Strategy”). The U.S. government’s three-pronged approach to combating wildlife trafficking – strengthening law enforcement, reducing demand, and building international cooperation – deprives criminals of a key source of financing, reducing the criminal threat posed to U.S. citizens.

The Task Force makes a difference on the ground at home and worldwide to combat wildlife trafficking. Task Force activities are coordinated across the U.S. government: efficiencies are identified and leveraged, redundancies eliminated, and resources used more strategically; international outreach continues to expand; and improved reporting has identified new areas for U.S. engagement. Collaborating with the private sector, local communities, and NGOs, the United States leads the way globally, securing agreements and commitments from governments and stakeholders to take urgent action at all levels. Highlights of Task Force efforts will appear in a separate strategic review, as called for in 16 USC 7631 (d).

Focus Countries

Methodology for Determining Focus Countries

With the 2022 reauthorization of the END Act, the Task Force established a new process for identifying Focus Countries. This process used the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s TOC Index, produced with U.S. government support, which is comprised of the most reliable data available on the levels of wildlife trafficking identified in source, transit, or destination countries for trafficked wildlife or wildlife products, and on the countries’ capacities to counter these crimes. The process also evaluated the efficacy of potential U.S. engagement with host governments in such countries to address the scourge of this malign trade. The Task Force then incorporated expert guidance into the process to evaluate information not otherwise accounted for, for example, from U.S. federal law enforcement analyses, embassy reporting on wildlife trafficking, NGO advisories, and available intelligence reports.

U.S. embassies supplied specific data, where available, on wildlife trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and punishments; campaigns to reduce demand for illegally sourced wildlife and wildlife products and to raise awareness about wildlife trafficking; and assessments of legal frameworks within each country purporting to address the problem adequately, among other indicators. These indicators measure inputs, outputs, or outcomes of law enforcement capacity building and cooperation efforts; the extent of any policy reform; and tailored demand reduction actions. They also measure how serious wildlife crime is perceived in each country.

U.S. missions in all 24 Focus Countries reported indicator data this year. Every post reported supporting host country wildlife law enforcement with training or other resources in the last two years. Twenty-one of 24 posts reported data on arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of wildlife traffickers. Eighteen posts reported existing laws treating wildlife trafficking as a serious crime. The Task Force also obtained data on demand reduction indicators for 11 of the 24 Focus Countries, reaching an estimated 197 million people.

The Task Force further evaluated whether governments had recently taken steps to improve legislation, regulations, and/or enforcement of their national laws, as well as evaluated other trends that might suggest that a country is increasing its efforts to combat illegal trade in wildlife.

2024 Focus Countries

The Department of State, in consultation with the Departments of the Interior and Commerce as required by the END Act, as well as the Department of Justice and USAID, determined 22 of the previous 28 countries and jurisdictions listed as Focus Countries in the 2021 END Act Report should remain listed. Each of those 22 countries continue as a “major source of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, a major transit point of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, or a major consumer of wildlife trafficking products.” The six countries that did not carry over from the 2021 END Act Report to this report fell off for several reasons. Hong Kong dropped because the Task Force no longer considered it sufficiently independent from the PRC to merit a separate inclusion. The remaining countries, Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates, fell off either due to the new methodology the Task Force used to identify Focus Countries, pursuant to the 2022 reauthorization of the END Act, or present separate challenges to implementation of U.S. activities. The Department of State further determined, again in consultation with these agencies, two additional countries should be designated as Focus Countries.

This determination is based on analysis of the statutory criteria in the Act and does not reflect a positive or negative judgment of the listed countries or indicate these countries are not working diligently to combat wildlife trafficking. Indeed, the United States has longstanding partnerships with many of these countries with respect to combating wildlife trafficking and recognizes strong political will already exists in many of these countries to tackle this problem. The Department and other Task Force agencies look forward to continuing close and constructive relationships with these countries as we collaborate to combat wildlife trafficking.

Consistent with 16 USC 7631, U.S. missions in each Focus Country will revise their strategic plans based on the respective mission’s assessment of wildlife trafficking within that country. U.S. agencies will use the strategic plans to guide and coordinate U.S. approaches and responses to the needs and gaps identified in the assessment. The Task Force co-chairs, along with USAID, have previously developed and distributed templates for both the assessments and strategic plans. All Task Force agencies, both at post and at agency headquarters, were invited to contribute to their development. The Task Force will review the updated assessments and strategic plans for completeness and consistency, recognizing variability based on location, resources within the U.S. mission, and previous engagement on the issue.

Together these documents will provide an overview of the issues related to wildlife trafficking in each country, identify key areas for strategic intervention by the U.S. government, and either establish a new platform or support existing structures within the mission to guide a coordinated, “whole of government” approach to interventions.

Countries of Concern

To identify Countries of Concern among the 24 Focus Countries as defined under 16 USC 7601 (5), the Department of State, in consultation with the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, as well as with the Department of Justice and USAID, reviewed publicly available information as well as classified material to identify governments actively engaged in or knowingly profiting from trafficking of endangered or threatened species. The Department of State designated the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Laos, and Madagascar as Countries of Concern in the first three END Act reports, 2017-19. In 2020, Cambodia, Cameroon, and Nigeria were added. There were no changes in 2021. For 2024, Task Force agencies spent considerable time reviewing the criteria that had led to the earlier designations, and the new, expanded scope of that designation under 16 USC 7601 (4)(B), and ultimately decided on no changes. The Country of Concern designation does not indicate that all parts of a government are or have been involved in wildlife trafficking, but it does indicate serious concerns either high-level or systemic government involvement has occurred. The Task Force will, among other things, ensure U.S. government agencies coordinate among themselves and with non-federal partners to implement the respective U.S. mission strategic plans developed in accordance with 16 USC 7631 (a)(2) of the Act, with a view to supporting these countries and their governments’ efforts to reduce trade in, and consumer demand for, illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products.

260624,"China (Includes Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet, and Xinjiang): Hong Kong","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), as well as other laws and policies, states that residents have freedom of conscience, freedom of religious belief, and freedom to preach, conduct, and participate in religious activities in public. The Bill of Rights Ordinance incorporates the religious freedom protections of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In 2020, the central government imposed a broad National Security Law (NSL) on Hong Kong with the stated aim of combating secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign powers.

The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Freedom House reported religious freedom was generally respected in Hong Kong, but the organization downgraded Hong Kong’s freedom of expression and belief rating during the year “due to evidence that the broader crackdown on dissent has prompted some churches to self-censor sermons and curtail other religious activities.” According to the report, Falun Gong adherents were free to practice in public but faced counterdemonstrations and harassment by groups with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. At year’s end, the trial of Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former Catholic Bishop of Hong Kong and an outspoken defender of civil rights in the SAR and mainland China, on suspicion of “collusion with foreign forces” remained pending. In March, the Hong Kong Taoist Association canceled a scheduled parade to celebrate “Taoist Day” in favor of a small, private event after police did not approve organizers’ request to hold the march. At a conference of Protestant leaders in April, participants said government retaliation for religious groups’ participation in social movements, the COVID-19 pandemic, the NSL, and emigration from Hong Kong since 2020 adversely affected local churches. According to a November report from the NGO Hong Kong Watch, some religious leaders said religious schools in the SAR, under pressure from the Hong Kong government, were “diluting religious education” due to new NSL and “patriotic” education mandates.

In April, Stephen Chow, Roman Catholic Bishop of Hong Kong, met with Roman Catholic Bishop of Beijing Joseph Li Shan in Beijing and wrote afterwards in the Hong Kong diocese’s official publication that the catechism states “the duty of the citizen is to cooperate with the government and to contribute to the welfare of society in an atmosphere of truth, justice, joint responsibility and freedom.” Chow’s comments drew mixed reactions. The Catholic News Agency for Asia published an opinion piece stating Chow’s visit to Beijing reflected the suppression of religious freedom in Hong Kong, but the Christian Times cited a Hong Kong Baptist University scholar saying that Chow’s remarks merely affirmed the Catholic Church’s view of patriotism as loving “the people who live in this country” rather than love for specific “political groups.” In November, Bishop Li of Beijing, president of the government-affiliated Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), attended a theological conference in Hong Kong. According to media reports, at the conference, Li promoted the “Sinicization” of faith and stressed the need to more closely combine Catholic faith and Chinese culture.

Religious leaders reported hosting and participating in interfaith activities, some of which the religious groups characterized as patriotic. Amid controversy among their members about separation of church and state, the Buddhist Association, Anglican Church, and Muslim community flew People’s Republic of China (PRC) flags in September and October to celebrate PRC National Day, and religious leaders made statements about the role of religion in supporting the government and promoting patriotism and national prosperity. Observers reported Christian churches in Hong Kong continued to provide spiritual and monetary support to underground churches in mainland China.

The U.S. Consul General and consular staff regularly met with a range of government officials managing religious affairs to obtain more information on government policies and advocate for greater religious freedom and tolerance. U.S. officials repeatedly raised concerns regarding the arrest of religious figures and the shrinking space for civil society, including religious groups, during meetings with official counterparts, religious leaders, NGOs, and community representatives, as well as in public messages. Throughout the year, U.S. officials attended religious events and organized public outreach events to promote religious freedom and tolerance.

Section I.
Religious Demography

The U.S. government estimates the total population at 7.3 million (midyear 2023). According to SAR government statistics from July 2022, there are more than one million followers of Taoism and more than one million followers of Buddhism; 480,000 Protestants; 379,000 Catholics; 300,000 Muslims; 100,000 Hindus; and 12,000 Sikhs. The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, which recognizes the Pope and maintains links to the Vatican, reported approximately 593,000 followers (395,000 citizens and 198,000 residents of other nationalities). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported it has approximately 25,100 members. According to the World Jewish Congress, there are approximately 2,500 Jews, primarily expatriates. Small communities of Baha’is and Zoroastrians also reside in the SAR. Confucianism is widespread, and, in some cases, elements of Confucianism are practiced in conjunction with other belief systems. The Falun Dafa Association estimates there are approximately 500 Falun Gong practitioners. There are numerous Protestant denominations, including Baptist, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican, the Church of Christ in China, Seventh-day Adventist, and Pentecostal groups.

Section II.
Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom

Legal Framework

The Basic Law states residents have freedom of conscience, freedom of religious belief, and freedom to preach, to conduct, and participate in religious activities in public. The Basic Law also states the government may not interfere in the internal affairs of religious organizations or restrict religious activities that do not contravene other laws. The Basic Law calls for ties between the region’s religious groups and their counterparts in mainland China based on “nonsubordination, noninterference, and mutual respect.” The Basic Law states that religious organizations “may maintain and develop their relations with religious organizations and believers elsewhere.”

The Bill of Rights Ordinance incorporates the religious freedom protections of the ICCPR, which include the right to manifest religious belief individually or in community with others, in public or private, and through worship, observance, practice, and teaching. The ordinance states persons belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities have the right to enjoy their own culture, profess and practice their own religion, and use their own language. The ordinance also protects the right of parents or legal guardians to “ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.” These rights may be limited when an emergency is proclaimed, and the “manifestation” of religious beliefs may be limited by law when necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals, or the rights of others. If a state of emergency is proclaimed, the rights may not be limited based solely on religion.

The NSL prohibits secession, subversion, terrorism, and “collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.” The law states that it shall override local laws if there are inconsistencies. The NSL states power to interpret the law lies with the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, not with local courts.

Religious groups are not legally required to register with the government. They must, however, register to receive government benefits such as tax-exempt status, rent subsidies, government or other professional development training, use of government facilities, or a grant to provide social services. To qualify for such benefits, a group must prove to the satisfaction of the government that it is established solely for religious, charitable, social, or recreational reasons. Registrants must provide the name and purpose of the organization, identify its office holders, and confirm the address of the principal place of business and any other premises the organization owns or occupies. If a religious group registers with the government, it enters the registry of all NGOs, but the government makes no adjudication on the validity of any registered groups. Religious groups may register as a society, a tax-exempt organization, or both, provided they have at least three members who hold valid SAR identity documents; the registration process normally takes approximately 12 working days. The Falun Dafa Association is registered as a society rather than a religious group; as a society, it may establish offices, collect dues from members, and have legal status.

Government tax regulations provide that any group, including religious groups, involved in activities deemed to endanger national security would not be recognized as a charitable organization.

The Basic Law allows private schools to provide religious education. A small percentage of government-funded schools are government-run; most government-funded schools are operated by religious groups, with the remainder operated by nonreligious charitable organizations. Government-subsidized schools must adhere to government curriculum standards and may not bar students based on religion, but they may provide nonmandatory religious instruction as part of their curriculum. Teachers may not discriminate against students because of their religious beliefs. The government curriculum mandates coursework on ethics and religious studies, with a focus on religious tolerance; it also includes elective modules on world religions.

The NSL stipulates the SAR “shall take necessary measures to strengthen public communication, guidance, supervision and regulation over matters concerning national security, including those relating to schools, universities, social organizations, the media, and the internet.” All schools following the Education Bureau curriculum, including private institutions and those run by religious groups, must incorporate lessons on “national security” into the curriculum, beginning at the kindergarten level. Private and international schools that do not receive funding from SAR authorities, including those run by religious groups, are not required to follow the guidelines, but the guidelines state that these schools have the “responsibility to help their students … acquire a correct and objective understanding and apprehension of the concept of national security and the National Security Law.”

Religious groups may apply to the government to lease land on concessional terms through a sponsorship from the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau. Religious groups may apply to develop or use facilities in accordance with local legislation.

The Chinese Temples Committee, led by the Secretary of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, oversees the management and logistical operations of 24 of the region’s 600 temples and gives grants to other charitable organizations. The SAR Chief Executive appoints its members. The committee provides grants to the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau for disbursement in the form of financial assistance to individuals in need. A colonial-era law does not require new temples to register to be eligible for Temples Committee assistance.

The Chief Executive Election Committee (CEEC) is composed of 1,500 members drawn from five sectors, divided into 40 subsectors, representing various trades, professions, and social services groups. The religious subsector, under the third sector (“Grassroots, labor, religious, and other”), is composed of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, Chinese Muslim Cultural and Fraternal Association, Hong Kong Christian Council, Hong Kong Taoist Association, Confucian Academy, and Hong Kong Buddhist Association. These six bodies are each entitled to 10 of the 60 seats of the religious subsector on the CEEC. The religious subsector is not required to hold elections under the Chief Executive Election Ordinance. Instead, each religious organization selects its electors according to its own rules. Each of the six designated religious groups is also a member of the Hong Kong Colloquium of Religious Leaders.

Government Practices

As of year’s end, the trial of 91-year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen on charges that he violated the NSL by “colluding with foreign forces” remained pending. Zen, the former Bishop of Hong Kong and an outspoken defender of civil rights in the SAR and mainland China, remained free on bail, following his arrest in December 2022. Zen had to surrender his travel documents, including his passport, to Hong Kong authorities as a condition of his bail; however, in January, the Hong Kong government allowed Zen to travel to the Vatican to attend the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, and media reported he met privately with Pope Francis.

Media outlets reported that on March 20, a court sentenced Alan Keung, founder of independent media outlet Free HK Media and known as “Pastor Keung,” and two others to 10 months in prison for selling a “seditious book” that discussed the 2019 prodemocracy protests.

In its Freedom in the World 2023 report, the NGO Freedom House stated that religious freedom was generally respected in Hong Kong, but the organization downgraded Hong Kong’s freedom of expression and belief rating from 4/4 in 2022 to 3/4 in 2023 “due to evidence that the broader crackdown on dissent has prompted some churches to self-censor sermons and other religious activities.” According to the report, Falun Gong adherents were free to practice in public but faced counterdemonstrations and harassment by groups with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. In an interview with the Catholic Reporter in November, Benedict Rogers, chief executive of the UK-based rights NGO Hong Kong Watch, said, “It’s fair to say … that freedom of worship, narrowly defined, is still intact. People in Hong Kong are still free to go to church, to the mosque, to the temple or the synagogue, to go to places of worship, and to access sacred scriptures and religious texts and literature.” He added, however, “It’s almost impossible to find clergy who will preach in their sermons on anything relating, explicitly or implicitly, to human rights, human dignity, freedom or justice. This essentially means co-option, coercion and corruption of religion.”

Vision Times reported that on April 21, a court sentenced Hu Aimin and Chow Wing-lam to 15 weeks and nine weeks in prison, respectively, for vandalizing six Falun Gong information booths in 2021. On April 3, a court acquitted a third defendant in the case, Zhou Jinshen, due to insufficient evidence.

Local media reported that in March, the Hong Kong Taoist Association canceled a scheduled parade to celebrate “Taoist Day.” Organizers instead held a religious assembly open only to members in a small soccer field in Kowloon. The association said it had expected approximately 1,600 persons to take part in the parade. An organizer told media outlets the group moved the event because police did not approve organizers’ request to hold the march, but police officials did not reply to media inquiries about whether they objected to the demonstration. Government officials and legislative council members attended the stadium rally.

The local outlet Christian Times reported that on April 17, the Jiandao Theological Seminary held a conference on “Shaping the Future of the Church in Hong Kong.” At the conference, which brought together more than 740 pastors, lay leaders, and seminarians, the heads of Hong Kong’s three largest Protestant denominational coalitions – the China Christian Evangelistic Association, Hong Kong Baptist Convention, and Hong Kong Federation of Chistian and Missionary Alliances – called for church leaders to display flexibility in the face of dwindling numbers and government pressure. Participants said government retaliation for religious groups’ participation in social movements, the COVID-19 pandemic, the NSL, and emigration from Hong Kong since 2020 all adversely affected local churches. According to the dean of Jiandao Theological Seminary, Cai Shaoqi, in recent years, the overall number of worshippers had dropped by 15 to 25 percent, while donations dropped 10 to 20 percent, and the number of pastors dropped 5 to 10 percent. In a closed-door meeting, leaders of seven different denominations discussed the challenges churches faced under the NSL and the need to cooperate with the Hong Kong Education Bureau.

The Christian Times reported that at the April 17 conference, Fan Kwok Kwong, general secretary of the Hong Kong Federation of Christian and Missionary Alliances, said that after two years of discussions with authorities over government concerns about the group allowing prodemocracy protestors to rest inside its church in 2019, authorities permitted it to continue holding meetings in the church. Fan said the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government, which represents the central government in Hong Kong, was actively communicating with federation leaders, and he reported that some local political leaders had blocked religious figures active in the 2019 prodemocracy movement from applying for new projects.

In April, shortly after the government lifted the COVID-19 mask mandate, media reported that some Catholics expressed concern about new police rules regarding participation in a march to mark Palm Sunday, including requirements that all marchers must wear a red ribbon and carry a palm branch. The media report also said the police did not permit marchers to wear masks. Police said the rule was in place to ensure participants did not use facial coverings to avoid being identified.

In June, the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong for the second consecutive year did not hold memorial masses on June 4 to honor the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. In 2022, the diocese’s Justice and Peace Commission, which had organized the masses for more than three decades, cited concern that the masses could violate the NSL.

A November report from Hong Kong Watch highlighted some Hong Kong religious leaders’ concerns that since the NSL went into effect, religious schools in Hong Kong, under pressure from the Hong Kong government, were “diluting religious education” due to new NSL and “patriotic” education mandates. Some Protestant Christian leaders also voiced concern about new difficulties reserving space in public schools for church activities, according to the report.

Section III.
Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom

Religious groups, some of which received government funding, provided a wide range of social services open to individuals regardless of religious affiliation, including welfare, elder care, hospitals, publishing services, employment services, rehabilitation centers, youth and community service functions, and other charitable activities. SAR officials reportedly attended some of those activities to show the government’s support for those religious groups.

According to an August telephone survey of Hong Kong residents by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, more than 500 responded and rated the degree of religious freedom in the SAR on average as 7.34 out of 10, compared with an average of 7.30 a year earlier.

Catholic media reported that in April, Stephen Chow, Bishop of Hong Kong, the most senior Catholic cleric in Hong Kong, who became a cardinal in September, and several senior priests went to Beijing, at the invitation of Bishop of Beijing Joseph Li Shan; this marked the first visit of a Hong Kong bishop to Beijing in nearly 30 years. In a press statement prior to the visit, Chow said he hoped to “promote exchanges and interactions” between the mainland and the broader Catholic Church in Asia. Following the visit to Beijing, Chow wrote in the diocese’s official publication Kung Kao Po that “patriotism is part of the Catholic Church’s teaching.” He said the catechism states “the duty of the citizen is to cooperate with the government and to contribute to the welfare of society in an atmosphere of truth, justice, joint responsibility and freedom,” and that “citizens are called to do their duty in the life of the political community.” Chow said he expected there would be opportunities for dialogue between the government and the Catholic Church, and that people should “help the government to become better for the sake of the country.” Separately, Chow told media that the Hong Kong church had a mission to be a “bridging church” between the West and China. In a May interview with the Italian Jesuit publication La Civilta Cattolica, Chow said, “According to one of the government officials whom we met during the trip, Sinicization is similar to our concept of inculturation.” He called for more dialogue with the mainland Catholic Church on the issue. Chow’s comments drew mixed reactions. The Catholic News Agency for Asia published an opinion piece stating Chow’s visit to Beijing reflected the suppression of religious freedom in Hong Kong, but the Christian Times cited a Hong Kong Baptist University scholar saying that Chow’s remarks merely affirmed the Catholic Church’s view of patriotism as loving “the people who live in this country” rather than love for specific “political groups.”

In November, Bishop Li, president of the government-affiliated CCPA, paid a reciprocal visit to Hong Kong, reportedly to strengthen ties between the two dioceses, and participated in a theological conference. According to media reports, Li promoted the Sinicization of faith and stressed the need to more closely combine Catholic faith and Chinese culture. Cardinal Chow also participated in the conference.

Religious leaders continued to participate in interfaith activities, some of which the groups characterized as patriotic. Several religious groups held ceremonies in September and October to mark the 74th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. On September 19, Buddhist, Catholic, Confucian, Muslim, Christian, and Taoist religious leaders and representatives of the local government and the central government’s liaison office attended a conference in Kowloon to celebrate the anniversary. In their speeches, religious leaders said the religious community had a role to play in promoting national prosperity.

Media reported that on September 28, the Buddhist Association held its first ever flag-raising ceremony for PRC National Day at a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong. Taking place at the Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island, Yin Zonghua, deputy director of the central government’s liaison office, was the officiating guest of honor; Master Kuan Yun, president of the Hong Kong Buddhist Federation, and Leung Wang-ching, deputy director of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau also attended. Monks offered prayers for the “prosperity and stability of the motherland.” Master Kuan Yun said the Buddhist community had always advocated patriotism, abiding by the law, loyalty to the country, and supporting the policies of the central and SAR governments.

Local media reported that on October 1, St John’s Anglican Cathedral, Hong Kong’s oldest church, displayed for the first time the PRC national flag during a service to commemorate PRC National Day and pray for the country. The move was reportedly suggested by lawmaker and Reverend Peter Koon, who was elected as a member of the city’s “patriot-only” legislature in December 2021. Koon dismissed online criticism of the decision to fly the PRC flag in the church, saying it stemmed from a “misunderstanding of our country” and that the Anglican Church had never separated the church and the state. Koon said the national flag would be displayed at National Day services in the future.

Radio Free Asia reported that in June, the Kowloon Mosque flew the PRC flag to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC. In October, the mosque flew the PRC flag to celebrate PRC National Day. PRC and Hong Kong government officials attended these events, which featured the PRC national anthem and members of the Muslim community marching in military style. Representatives of the liaison office, senior government and police officials, senior Muslim leaders, and personnel from the consulates general of Egypt, Pakistan, and Qatar in Hong Kong also attended. The organizers stressed that the raising of the PRC flag at the mosque was in compliance with China’s religious guidelines of “patriotism and love of religion” and “Sinicization of Islam.” According to media outlets, the Muslim community was divided on the issue, with some community members calling the raising of the flag “a normal thing,” while others expressed concern, calling it a “blasphemy.”

Observers reported that Christian churches in Hong Kong continued to provide underground churches in mainland China with spiritual and monetary support, including Bibles and Christian literature and visits from church members. Some Hong Kong churches reported that they were able to conduct cross-border online services, while others, including the Catholic Church, reported PRC authorities prohibited individuals in mainland China from attending their online services.

Section IV.
U.S. Government Policy and Engagement

The U.S. Consul General and consular staff repeatedly raised concerns regarding the arrest of religious figures and the shrinking space for civil society, including religious groups, during meetings with a range of official counterparts. In these meetings, consulate general officials, including the Consul General, stressed the importance of religious pluralism, tolerance, and the role religious groups played in addressing social issues.

Consulate general officials, including the Consul General, also continued to meet with a wide range of religious organizations, including Buddhist, Catholic, Taoist, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and Protestant religious leaders and adherents to emphasize the importance of religious freedom and tolerance and to receive reports regarding the status of religious freedom both in Hong Kong and in mainland China. They also met with NGOs and community representatives regarding the same topics.

During the year, the consulate conducted outreach to religious communities and the broader public that promoted religious pluralism and tolerance. On May 20, the consulate organized a cultural event for 60 members of the general public at the Khalsa Diwan Sikh Temple in Hong Kong, where two diplomats discussed their Asian American heritage and shared their thoughts on cultural diversity, while members of the temple talked about the history and community role of Sikhism. In November, the consulate sponsored, promoted, and delivered opening remarks at the screenings of two American films at the 24th annual Jewish Film Festival in Hong Kong, including one focused on the history of antisemitism. In connection with the festival, the Consul General and members of other diplomatic missions and civil society groups attended a Shabbat dinner hosted by the Jewish community.

In October, the consulate hosted a three-day visit by a Catholic University professor and consultant to the Holy See Mission to the United Nations, who met with members of academia, civil society, and the religious community in Hong Kong to discuss conflict, reconciliation, and strategic peacebuilding. The consulate convened an interfaith roundtable with Jewish, Sikh, Muslim, and Christian faith leaders, academics, and the visiting professor to discuss religious freedom. The professor also delivered lectures for professors and students of religious education, met with high school teachers and NGOs to discuss peacebuilding, and trained social workers from a religious organization on reconciliation work"
260624,"China (Includes Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet, and Xinjiang): Macau","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Basic Law of the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) grants residents freedom of religious belief, freedom to preach and participate in religious activities in public, and freedom to pursue religious education. These rights may be limited in extraordinary situations for national security reasons. The law protects the right of religious assembly and stipulates religious groups may develop and maintain relations with religious groups abroad. Under the Basic Law, the SAR government, rather than the central government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), safeguards religious freedom in the SAR. Bylaws to the National Security Law (NSL) give the local Judiciary Police investigative authority over religious groups and personnel.

Most religious groups in the SAR maintained close ties with the PRC government. According to a government report, senior government officials regularly consulted with religious leaders as part of a Beijing-led strategy to foster greater regional religious and cultural exchange within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. Some religious activists in the diaspora called on the PRC government to allow greater religious expression in the SAR, as provided for by the Basic Law. One former legislator said police prohibited Falun Gong adherents from setting up information stalls at the Ruins of St. Paul’s, claiming they obstructed pedestrian movement.

The Catholic Church in Macau continued to recognize the Pope as its head, and the Holy See appointed the bishop of the diocese. Despite some restrictions, Falun Gong practitioners reported they generally continued to be able to discuss their beliefs openly with Macau residents. Some media reports portrayed Falun Gong members negatively.

In exchanges with SAR government officials, civil society representatives, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), representatives from the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong and Macau stressed the importance of religious diversity and religious freedom and discussed religious communities’ relations with their coreligionists on the mainland and in Hong Kong. In June, the Consul General visited multiple religious sites in Macau and met with a local Catholic charity.

Section I.
Religious Demography

The U.S. government estimates the total population of Macau at 640,000 (midyear 2023). According to a 2022 estimate by the research group Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA), as of 2020, 58.7 percent of the population are folk religionists, 17.3 percent Buddhist, 4.9 percent Catholic, 1.6 percent Protestant, 15.8 percent nonreligious, and less than 2 percent other religious groups, including other Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, and Jews.

The SAR Government Information Bureau 2023 yearbook states a majority of the population practices Buddhism or Chinese folk religions. The yearbook does not provide an estimate for Buddhists, but it states they are numerous, and individuals often practice a mixture of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Chinese folk religions. The SAR Government Information Bureau estimates 5 percent of the population is Catholic (approximately 32,400), of whom almost half are foreign domestic workers and other expatriates, and 1.2 percent of the population are Protestant (approximately 8,000). Protestant denominations include Church of the United Brethren, Church of Christ in China, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Assemblies of God, Baptists, and Anglicans. Evangelical Christian and independent local nondenominational churches, some of which are affiliated with officially recognized mainland churches, are also present. ARDA estimates the Muslim population at 1,300, the majority of whom are Sunni. Smaller religious groups include Baha’is; ARDA approximates their membership at 200. Falun Gong practitioners estimate their numbers at 20 to 50 persons.

Section II.
Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom

Legal Framework

The Basic Law states residents have freedom of religious belief and the freedom to publicly preach, as well as to conduct and participate in religious activities. These rights may be limited in extraordinary situations for national security reasons. The Basic Law further stipulates the government shall not interfere in the internal affairs of religious groups or in their relations with their counterparts outside Macau. It bars the government from restricting religious activities that do not contravene the laws of the SAR.

Under the Basic Law, the SAR government, rather than the central government of the PRC, safeguards religious freedom in the SAR.

The law states there is no official religion in the SAR and stipulates all religious denominations are equal before the law. The law provides for freedom of religion, including privacy of religious belief, freedom of religious assembly, freedom to hold religious processions, and freedom of religious education. Under the SAR’s NSL bylaws, the Judiciary Police has four national security branches that have investigative authority over religious groups and personnel, among others: the National Security Information Division; the National Security Crime Investigation Division; the National Security Action Support Division; and the National Security Affairs Integrated Service Division.

Religious groups are not required to register to conduct religious activities, but registration enables them to benefit from legal status. Benefits include exemption from taxation (such as property tax, stamp duty, complementary tax [profit tax], and industrial tax) and receiving financial assistance from the government. Religious groups who choose to register must do so with the Identification Bureau, providing the name of an individual applicant and that person’s position in the group, identification card number, and contact information, as well as the group’s name and a copy of the group’s charter. Registered charities receive the same benefits as registered religious groups. Religious groups need to be registered separately as a charity under a different name in order to provide charitable services.

The law states that religious organizations may run seminaries and schools, hospitals, and welfare institutions, and provide other social services.

There is no religious education in public schools. A small number of schools operated by religious organizations receive no public funding, and these schools may require students to receive religious education.

By law, religious groups may develop and maintain relations with religious groups abroad.

Government Practices

Most religious groups in the SAR maintained close ties with the central government. During the year, multiple provincial government delegations from the mainland met with local religious leaders during visits to the SAR. The SAR government reported it had a long-standing relationship with local religious communities. According to a government report issued in January, senior officials regularly consulted with religious leaders as part of a Beijing-led strategy to foster greater regional religious and cultural exchange within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. Under this initiative, the Buddhist federations of Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, and Macau, with support from the Macau Foundation and the SAR’s Cultural Affairs Bureau, held a Buddhist Puja in Macau in December 2022 to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the transfer of sovereignty over Macau to the PRC.

Some religious activists in the diaspora called on the PRC government to allow greater religious expression in the SAR, as provided for by the Basic Law. A former lawmaker said that although in prior years Falun Gong practitioners had been tacitly allowed to set up promotion stalls at the city’s landmark Ruins of St. Paul’s, after 2022, police refused to approve their stalls saying the stalls obstructed pedestrian movement.

Some religious groups continued to report they retained their ability to conduct charitable activities on the mainland by working through official channels and officially recognized churches.

The government continued to provide financial support to a variety of religious groups to establish schools, child-care centers, clinics, homes for the elderly, rehabilitation centers, and vocational training centers. The government also continued to refer victims of human trafficking to religious organizations for the provision of support services.

On January 9, at a meeting with representatives of several religious groups, Chief Executive Ho Lat Seng said the government had always respected diverse religious beliefs and that residents enjoyed freedom of religion. Ho praised religious groups’ activities to “help residents tide over the difficult times,” including the COVID-19 pandemic, and said he and hoped they would continue “to uphold the spirit of doing good and convey positive messages to the general population, especially the young people of Macau.”

Section III.
Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom

The Catholic Church in Macau continued to recognize the Pope as its head. The Holy See appointed the bishop for the diocese. The Catholic Diocese of Macau continued to run many educational institutions, either directly or through other Catholic groups, including approximately one-third of the 64 private primary and secondary schools.

Despite some restrictions, Falun Gong practitioners reported they generally continued to be able to discuss their beliefs openly with Macau residents. Some media reports portrayed Falun Gong members negatively.

Section IV.
U.S. Government Policy and Engagement

The U.S. government was represented in Macau by the U.S. Consulate General, Hong Kong and Macau, located in Hong Kong. In exchanges with SAR government officials, civil society representatives, and NGOs, representatives from the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong and Macau, including the Consul General, stressed the importance of religious diversity and religious freedom and discussed religious communities’ relations with their coreligionists on the mainland and in Hong Kong.

In June, the Consul General made his first post-pandemic official trip to Macau, where he visited the Morrison Chapel and the Old Protestant Cemetery and met with a local Catholic charity."

070624,Report to Congress on Access to Tibetan Areas – Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 (8 U.S.C. 1182 note),"Executive Summary

This is the sixth annual report under Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 (8 U.S.C. 1182 note), enacted December 19, 2018, which requires the Department of State to provide a report to Congress, within 90 days of enactment and annually thereafter for five years, regarding the level of access People’s Republic of China (PRC) authorities granted to U.S. diplomats and officials, journalists, and tourists to the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas in China, including a comparison with the level of access granted to other areas of China; a comparison between the levels of access to Tibetan and non-Tibetan areas in relevant provinces; a comparison of the level of access compared to the previous reporting year; and a description of the required permits and other measures that impede travel in Tibetan areas. This report covers 2023, with comparisons to 2022, as applicable.

The outbreak of COVID-19 in January 2020 led to country-wide restrictions on travel within China and entry to China, which impacted the ability of foreign diplomats, journalists, and tourists to travel to the TAR and other Tibetan areas. Domestic COVID-19 controls were lifted in late 2022, including as regards travel to the TAR.

However, PRC government regulations and procedures that have historically impeded travel to the TAR and Tibetan areas outside the TAR for U.S. diplomats and officials, journalists, and tourists remained in place in 2023. International visitors’ travel to the TAR continued to require the approval of TAR government travel permits. In 2023, U.S. officials made three requests for official travel to the TAR, none of which were approved. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, U.S. officials made no requests to visit the TAR in 2022; one request was made in 2021, which the TAR government denied. For diplomats and officials, travel to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR did not require a permit or special notification beyond the requirements in place for other parts of China. PRC security forces have used conspicuous surveillance to intimidate, monitor, harass, and restrict the movements of U.S. diplomats, officials, and foreigners, including while on personal travel to Tibetan areas. Tibetan Americans regularly have faced restrictions on their travel to Tibetan areas, although anecdotal reports suggest Tibetan Americans had more access to the TAR than in 2022. Access to these areas for journalists remained restricted and limited.

Impact of the Suspension of Operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu

Due to the PRC government’s withdrawal of consent for operation in retaliation to the United States’ withdrawal of consent for the operation of PRC Consulate General Houston, the United States suspended operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu (CG Chengdu) on July 27, 2020. The suspension of operations at CG Chengdu resulted in Embassy Beijing taking responsibility for coverage of the TAR and Tibetan areas more than 800 miles away from Beijing. This has severely inhibited the U.S. Mission’s ability to maintain access to Tibetan areas.

Differences in Access to Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan Areas

While China maintains clear and strict access requirements for travel to the TAR, access requirements to travel to sensitive Tibetan areas in other provinces remained ambiguous. Tibetan areas, which are prefectures and counties containing historic and current Tibetan populations outside of the TAR, exist in Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces. Municipal and prefecture-level PRC and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials are often responsible for access restrictions to these areas, resulting in differing conditions and making it difficult to determine the rationale and timing for these restrictions.

Comparison with the Level of Access Granted to the Tibetan and Non-Tibetan Areas of China

Diplomats and other officials

In 2023, the TAR continued to be the only area of China that PRC authorities required diplomats and other foreign officials to formally request permission to visit. Diplomats could not purchase air or train tickets to enter the TAR without official approval.

Diplomats and other foreign officials did not face additional formal restrictions on travel to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR; however, PRC officials sometimes used conspicuous surveillance to intimidate, monitor, harass, and restrict travel to these areas.

During the reporting year, the U.S. mission personnel were unable to conduct any American Citizen Services visits to the TAR in 2023 because requests for visits by consular officers were not approved. No consular officer has visited the TAR since 2019. In previous years, local officials in the TAR had been responsive to consular requests to provide assistance to U.S. citizens but occasionally delayed their response on emergency access requests made by U.S. consular officers.

Tourists

PRC government regulations controlled travel of international visitors to the TAR for tourism, a restriction applied by no other provincial-level entity in China. In accordance with a 1989 central government regulation, international visitors, including U.S. citizens, were required to obtain an official confirmation letter issued by the TAR government, which reports to the central government in Beijing, before entering the TAR. Most tourists received such letters by booking tours through travel agencies officially registered with the PRC government. The PRC government mandated a designated tour guide accompany international tourists while in the TAR. Foreigners rarely obtained permission to enter the TAR by road. Authorities denied access to the TAR for many international tourists during periods the PRC government considered politically sensitive, including the March anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan Uprising against China’s invasion of Tibet and the Dalai Lama’s birthday in July.

The TAR Tourism Bureau reported that from January to June 2022, TAR received over 17 million tourists. In 2019 CG Chengdu estimated roughly 10,000 U.S. citizens visited the region. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, U.S. Embassy Beijing believes the number of U.S. citizens who visited the TAR to have decreased substantially in 2020-2022. It is not known how many U.S. citizens visited the TAR in 2023, but numbers likely fall far short of those seen in 2019.

Tibetan Americans undergo a stricter screening process than other U.S. citizens when applying for PRC visas at PRC embassies. Their applications are processed through the United Front Work Department (UFWD), often require a letter from a relative or host in the Tibetan area, an in person interview with the PRC Embassy or Consulate officer in charge of Tibetan affairs, and submission of personal documents such as copies of naturalization certificates, birth certificates, school and work records, affidavits and other materials. Tibetan Americans reported more frequent harassment by security officials in Tibetan areas than in other parts of China, including requirements to report to the local UFWD office where some were reportedly interrogated, threatened, and forced to download tracking software on their phones. Some members of the Tibetan American community reported they self-censored their behavior in the United States out of fear of retribution against their family members in Tibet or fear of losing future access to Tibet and threats from PRC officials. Despite these barriers, Tibetans also reported increased access to the TAR compared to previous years, particularly for those who hold United States or European passports. This information is anecdotal, with no concrete data available on the number of visas issued to Tibetan Americans.

Journalists

PRC regulations did not regularly require international journalists to obtain prior permission to travel to any part of the country other than the TAR. The PRC government heavily restricted and controlled access for U.S. journalists to the TAR. The PRC government has rejected the vast majority of U.S. journalists’ requests to visit and report from the TAR, according to data compiled by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC), the professional organization for the international press corps based in China. When access was granted, PRC security officials monitored and controlled these journalists’ movements at all times. The FCCC’s 2022 annual report stated that none of the three foreign journalists who applied to travel to TAR were approved. In lieu of individual permits, the government relied on organized group tours of the region for registered reporters selected by PRC authorities.

When U.S. journalists gained access to Tibetan areas, the PRC government further suppressed their ability to report about Tibet by intimidating and preventing PRC citizens from interacting with foreign press. By hosting group tours, the government has been able to cite increased numbers and greater access to the region while maintaining strict control over the information conveyed.

Comparison Between Levels of Access for Tibetan and Non-Tibetan Areas

Diplomats and other officials

U.S. diplomats and other officials did not have to apply to travel to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR, though sometimes access to specific areas would be blocked and official meetings with local government, religious, and community leaders required local Foreign Affairs Office (FAO) permission, as was common practice in many localities throughout China. PRC security personnel have used conspicuous monitoring to intimidate those traveling to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR. Government-designated minders have followed diplomats and officials, prevented them from meeting or speaking with local contacts, questioned them, and restricted their movement. Official access to monasteries in Tibetan areas of Kardze (Chinese: Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP) in Sichuan province and Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) TAP in Sichuan province remained limited. During visits in previous years to Tibetan areas in Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Yunnan provinces, local authorities have prohibited U.S. diplomats from entering certain monasteries, blocked off specific roads, prevented them from having meetings or conversations with local interlocutors, and monitored their conversations.

Tourists

International tourists sometimes faced restrictions traveling to Tibetan areas outside the TAR. Some particularly sensitive areas, including areas with prominent monasteries or those with histories of protest activities, such as Ngaba (which saw a number of self-immolations following the 2008 uprising), restrict international tourists’ access.

Journalists

Although journalists were permitted to travel to areas outside the TAR with significant Tibetan populations, they have been subjected to invasive surveillance, physically blocked from certain areas, and intimidated by the government. According to the FCCC’s annual report covering 2022, foreign journalists experienced harassment while reporting in Tibetan areas outside the TAR.

Comparison of the Level of Access Between 2023 and 2022

Diplomats and other officials

Access to the Tibetan population of the PRC did not improve in 2023 compared to 2022. While COVID-19 restrictions have been rescinded, requests by U.S. and other diplomats to travel to the TAR have not been approved. The PRC has arranged tours of foreign diplomats as well as diplomatic events in the TAR, although in all cases, these are strictly controlled by the PRC government and do not allow meaningful access to the population of the TAR.

Journalists

The FCCC’s 2022 annual report noted that access to the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) remains officially restricted for foreign journalists. Reporters must apply to the government for special permission or join a press tour organized by China’s State Council or Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). Three journalists applied for permission in 2022, but all were turned down. The report cites a journalist from a Western outlet who was stopped and detained by police and local officials in a Tibetan area of Sichuan, with officials claiming foreigners were not being allowed in because of COVID controls.

Required Permits and Other Measures Impeding Freedom to Travel in Tibetan areas

In addition to the permits and other restrictions described above, visitors whose requests for a Tibet travel permit the PRC government approved in previous years have faced additional access barriers once in the TAR. According to travel agents operating in the TAR, the Tibet travel permit did not allow visits to all areas. Some areas were generally closed to visitors and required an additional alien travel permit from the TAR Public Security Bureau. Tourists planning to visit certain border areas also required a military area entry permit from the Military Affairs Office and a foreign affairs permit from the TAR FAO.

The PRC government did not disclose its decision-making process for granting permission to travel to the TAR, nor did it share the names of officials involved in issuing travel permits to U.S. citizens to visit the TAR.

Historically, PRC authorities assessed each U.S. official request to visit the TAR on a case-by-case basis. The TAR FAO generally required a diplomatic note for any official visit, accompanied by a list of trip attendees. Once the TAR government received the request, it reportedly informed a foreign affairs leading committee, consisting of representatives at the prefectural, provincial, and central levels from the UFWD, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Public Security, People’s Liberation Army, and MFA. This committee reviewed the request, although frequently, no specific response was provided."

Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom including censorship; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; inability of citizens to change their government peacefully through free and fair elections; serious and unreasonable restrictions on political participation; and trafficking in persons.

The government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who may have committed human rights abuses.

Section 1.
Respect for the Integrity of the Person

a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings

There were no reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.

b. Disappearance

There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities.

c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and Other Related Abuses

The law prohibited such practices, and there were no credible reports government officials employed them.

Prison and Detention Center Conditions

There were no significant reports regarding conditions that raised human rights concerns.

Administration: The law allowed prisoners and detainees to submit complaints to judicial authorities without censorship and to request investigation of alleged deficiencies. Judges and prosecutors in previous years visited prisons at least once a month to hear prisoner complaints.

Independent Monitoring: The government permitted monitoring by independent nongovernmental observers.

d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention

The law prohibited arbitrary arrest and detention and provided for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of their arrest or detention in court, and the government generally observed these requirements.

Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees

Authorities detained persons with warrants issued by a duly authorized official based on evidence deemed sufficient by the authorities. Detainees had access to a lawyer of their choice or, if indigent, to one provided by the government. Police were required to present persons in custody to an examining judge within 48 hours of detention. Investigations by the prosecuting attorney were required to end with charges or dismissal within eight months, or six months when the defendant remained in detention. The pretrial inquiry stage was required to conclude within four months, or two months if the defendant was in detention. There was a functioning bail system.

e. Denial of Fair Public Trial

The law provided for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence and impartiality. Observers said that administrative actions by the court in some cases affected the fairness of the proceedings. For example, a March prosecution alleged two former directors of the public works bureau took bribes to facilitate local property development. The defense lawyers filed a complaint noting the judge rejected their request to rehear witnesses after the prosecution amended the charge sheet and limited the duration of closing statements for each defendant to 40 minutes. Observers argued such arrangements undermined the defendants’ right to a competent and effective defense.

Trial Procedures

The law provided for the right to a fair public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right.  A case could be presided over by one judge or a group of judges, depending on the type of crime and the maximum penalty involved.

The Special Administrative Region’s (SAR) civil code judicial system derived from the Portuguese legal system.  The courts could rule on matters that were the responsibility of the government of the People’s Republic of China or concern the relationship between central authorities and the SAR.  Before making their final judgment, which was not subject to appeal, the courts had to seek an interpretation of the relevant provisions from the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.  The Basic Law required that courts follow the standing committee’s interpretations when cases intersect with central government jurisdiction, although judgments previously rendered were not affected.  As the final interpreter of the Basic Law, the standing committee also had the power to initiate interpretations of the Basic Law.

Political Prisoners and Detainees

There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.

f. Transnational Repression

Not applicable.

g. Property Seizure and Restitution

Not applicable.

h. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence

The law prohibited such actions, and there were no reports that the government failed to respect these prohibitions. The SAR’s public surveillance system included facial recognition capabilities; legal experts and opposition leaders feared the system could be used to target individuals and breach privacy laws.

The law regulating the interception and protection of communications (commonly known as “wiretapping law”) came into effect in August 2022. It allowed authorities, with prior authorization from a judge, to use “eavesdropping devices” to intercept or record telephone or other electronic communications without the consent of the parties involved. The law also allowed police to request communication records from social media operators, even if they were not located or headquartered in the SAR. Some activists expressed concerns that the provisions of the wiretapping bill were an overly broad expansion of surveillance authority.

The amended National Security Law (NSL), which came into effect in May, permitted the interception of communications with prior judicial consent when the content was deemed to present a risk to national security. Unlike the wiretapping law, any alleged national security information intercepted by authorities had to be approved by a designated judge before being admissible in court, otherwise it was classified as intelligence for law enforcement purposes only.

Section 2.
Respect for Civil Liberties

a. Freedom of Expression, Including for Members of the Press and Other Media

The law provided for freedom of expression, including for members of the press and other media, but the government encroached upon this right.

Freedom of Expression: The government significantly restricted public statements that it contended would undermine “social harmony” or that “endangered” national or public interest.

In January a Hong Kong resident who criticized the Hong Kong government online was denied entry into the SAR on the grounds that his public remarks contained seditious content. Border authorities also denied entry to a Hong Kong district councilor in March after deeming his remarks to be a risk to Macau’s public security. Some observers criticized broad provisions of the amended NSL, noting it could allow for arbitrary law enforcement and potentially result in a chilling effect on media and individual freedoms.

Censorship or Content Restrictions for Members of the Press and Other Media, Including Online Media: The SAR imposed restrictions on press freedom and urged media to align itself with government positions. The Reporters Without Borders East Bureau director criticized the revised NSL’s broad and extraterritorial remit as “increase[ing] the pressure on journalists and further threaten[ing] the residents’ right to information.” Reporters Without Borders also noted “the original regulation was already dangerously open to interpretation, and the expansion of its scope makes it the perfect tool for the government to intimidate, and possibly detain, the journalists they dislike.”

The Macau Journalists Association published several critiques in recent years on the seriousness of censorship of media, noting limits on coverage of prodemocracy activists and organizations, barring the use of names in certain reports, and the removal or alteration of reports that did not comply with government directives.

Libel/Slander Laws: The law criminalized libel, slander, and defamation. If such offenses were committed through media or online, conviction carried sentences of up to two years’ imprisonment. There were no reports the law was used.

Internet Freedom

There were no public reports that the government overtly restricted or disrupted access to the internet or censor online content.

b. Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association

The law provided for the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association, but the government restricted the freedom of peaceful assembly.

Freedom of Peaceful Assembly

The law required prior notification to, but did not require approval by, the Public Security Police for demonstrations involving public roads, public places, or places open to the public. Police could redirect demonstration marching routes, but organizers had the right to challenge such decisions in court. Civil rights advocates criticized the apparently arbitrary rules restricting peaceful assembly.

In June the Tiananmen Square massacre commemoration organizer in the SAR – the Union for Democratic Development – announced it had officially disbanded, citing fear of political prosecution under the NSL. It highlighted a 2022 court ruling that annual commemorations held for the past three decades were unlawful and subversive in nature.

c. Freedom of Religion

See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report at https://www.state.gov/religiousfreedomreport/.

d. Freedom of Movement

The law provided for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights.

The amended NSL enacted in May empowered authorities to restrict the departure of anyone in the SAR suspected of violating national security laws for up to five days, with prior approval from judicial authorities.

e. Protection of Refugees

The government communicated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations regarding the few applicants for refugee or asylum status who arrived in the SAR.

Access to Asylum: The law provided for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and there was a system for providing protection to refugees. Persons granted refugee status ultimately enjoyed the same rights as other SAR residents.

Pending final decisions on their asylum claims, the government registered asylum seekers and provided protection against their expulsion or return to their countries of origin. There were few applicants for refugee or asylum status and no successful applicants.

Persons with pending applications were eligible to receive government support, including for basic needs such as housing, medical care, and education for children, but were not allowed to work until their refugee status was granted.

Section 3.
Freedom to Participate in the Political Process

The law limited voters’ ability to change their government through free and fair periodic elections because there was no universal suffrage in elections for most elected positions. Only a small fraction of citizens played a role in the selection of the chief executive, who was chosen in 2019 by a 400-member election committee, 344 of whom were elected from four broad societal sectors: the industrial, commercial, and financial sector; the cultural, educational, and professional sector; the sports sector; and the labor, social services, religious, and others sector. The remaining 56 members were chosen from and by the SAR’s legislators and representatives to the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.

Elections and Political Participation

Abuses or Irregularities in Recent Elections: The elections in 2021 for 14 directly elected seats in the 33-member Legislative Assembly were not generally free and fair, as the government disqualified all prodemocracy politicians from running.

Political Parties and Political Participation: The SAR had no laws on political parties. Politically active groups registered as societies or limited liability companies were active in promoting their political agendas. Those seeking elected office had to swear their allegiance to Macau and to upholding the Basic Law. Those critical of the government faced restrictions and were disqualified from running in the most recent election.

Section 4.
Corruption in Government

The law provided criminal penalties for official corruption, and the government generally implemented the law effectively. The SAR’s Commission Against Corruption was a statutory independent body whose main duty was to combat corruption, bribery, and other illegal activities in both public and private sectors. SAR residents could report corruption or administrative misconduct by name or anonymously.

Corruption: The Commission Against Corruption investigated the public and private sectors and had the power to arrest and detain suspects. The Ombudsman Bureau within the commission reviewed complaints of mismanagement or abuse by the commission. An independent monitoring committee outside the commission accepted and reviewed complaints concerning commission personnel.

For additional information about corruption in the SAR, see the Department of State’s Investment Climate Statement, and the Department of State’s International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which includes information on financial crimes.

Section 5.
Governmental Posture Towards International and Nongovernmental Monitoring and Investigation of Alleged Abuses of Human Rights

Domestic and international groups monitoring human rights generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials were somewhat cooperative and responsive to their views.

Section 6.
Discrimination and Societal Abuses

Women

Rape and Domestic Violence: The law criminalized rape of women and men, including spousal rape, and domestic violence, although the domestic violence law did not cover same-sex couples. Rape was punishable by three to 12 years’ imprisonment; the law on rape was effectively enforced.

The domestic violence law allowed a judge to order urgent coercive measures against alleged abusers for up to five years, and the application of these measures did not preclude the possibility of criminal prosecution of the suspects. Domestic violence was punishable by one to five years imprisonment; sentences could be increased if a victim was younger than age 14. The government did not effectively enforce the domestic violence law. Lawmakers and social welfare nongovernmental organizations stated the enforcement of the domestic violence law was insufficient, as there was a high number of reports but insufficient investigation and prosecution of reported cases.

Other Forms of Gender-based Violence or Harassment: The law criminalized physical sexual harassment, but verbal and noncontact forms of harassment were not covered by the law. There were no public reports that the government did not effectively enforce the law. Persons convicted of sexual harassment could be imprisoned for up to one year.

Discrimination: Women enjoyed the same legal rights as men, including civil liberties, employment, commercial activity, and education. Equal opportunity legislation mandated women receive equal pay for equal work. The law prohibited discrimination in hiring practices based on gender or physical ability and allowed for civil suits. Penalties existed for employers who violated these guidelines, and the government generally enforced the law effectively. Media reports, however, indicated discrimination persisted and gender differences in occupation existed, with women concentrated in lower-paid sectors and lower-level jobs.

In March, a United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ report noted gender stereotypes still had a significant impact on women’s participation in the labor market, leading most women to enter traditionally women-dominated sectors such as catering, while the number of women in senior positions in government and private companies remained low.

Reproductive Rights: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government authorities.

The government provided access to sexual and reproductive health services for sexual violence survivors, including emergency contraception and postexposure prophylaxis.

Systemic Racial or Ethnic Violence and Discrimination

The law did not fully protect members of racial or ethnic minority groups against violence and discrimination.

Children

Child Abuse: The law prohibited any form of mistreatment or cruel treatment of children. The law included corporal punishment of children among criminal forms of violence if committed with the intention of harming a child.

Child, Early, and Forced Marriage: The minimum legal age of marriage was 16; however, children ages 16 to 18 who wished to marry had to obtain approval from their parents or guardians. There were no public reports that the government did not enforce the law effectively.

Sexual Exploitation of Children: The law specifically provided for criminal punishment for sexual abuse of children and students, statutory rape, and procurement of children for sexual exploitation. The criminal code set 14 years as the age of sexual consent.

The law forbade using a person younger than age 18 for commercial sexual exploitation, including child sex trafficking. The law also prohibited child pornography. The government generally enforced these laws effectively, but there were concerns regarding the exploitation of children in commercial sex.

Sexual harassment of children was also a crime; if the victim was younger than age 14, the perpetrator could be punished with up to three years in prison.

Antisemitism

The Jewish population was extremely small. There were no reports of antisemitic incidents.

Trafficking in Persons

See the Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/.

Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity or Expression, or Sex Characteristics

Criminalization: The law did not criminalize consensual same-sex sexual conduct between individuals.

Violence and Harassment: Reports of violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex (LGBTQI+) individuals were rare, and civil society organizations generally assessed police response as adequate.

Discrimination: The law prohibited discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation and was enforced; however, the law did not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in other areas, such as housing. The SAR did not recognize same-sex marriage.

Availability of Legal Gender Recognition: Legal gender recognition was not available, even for those who had undergone gender-affirming surgery outside of the SAR.

Involuntary or Coercive Medical or Psychological Practices: Rainbow of Macau, an LGBTQI+ organization, did not report any cases of so-called conversion therapy, nor did the SAR government or medical associations condemn so-called conversion therapy practices.

Restrictions of Freedom of Expression, Association, or Peaceful Assembly: There were no reports of such restrictions specifically for LGBTQI+ individuals or groups. In February a group of LGBTQI+ advocates successfully organized the first-ever Macau International Queer Film Festival, showcasing 17 films.

Persons with Disabilities

Persons with disabilities could access education, health services, public buildings, and transportation on an equal basis with others. The law mandated access to buildings, public facilities, information, and communications for persons with disabilities. The government enforced the law effectively. The SAR operated an education system for students with special educational needs or disabilities. The government excluded persons with disabilities and domestic workers from the minimum wage law. The law prohibited discrimination in hiring practices based on gender or physical ability and allowed for civil suits.

Section 7.
Worker Rights

a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining

Although the Basic Law provided for the right of workers to form and join unions, the Legislative Assembly had not passed legislation to regulate this right. Because workers had the right to join labor associations, unions existed in the form of ordinary associations and could therefore only express nonbinding opinions to management. Moreover, the government wielded considerable influence over some of these labor associations.

The law did not provide the right for workers to bargain collectively, and while workers had a legal right to conduct strikes, there was no specific protection in the law from retribution if workers exercised that right, and no strikes occurred. The law prohibited some “antiunion” discrimination, stated employees or job seekers should not be prejudiced, deprived of any rights, or exempted from any duties based on their membership in a labor association. There were no reports the government threatened or was violent towards labor leaders. The law stipulated the financial penalties for antiunion discrimination; an employer could be fined for every worker discriminated against. The law did not require reinstatement of workers dismissed for union activity.

The law forbade workers in certain professions, such as the security forces, to form unions, to take part in protests, or to strike. Such groups had organizations that provided welfare and other services to members and could speak to the government on behalf of members. Most other public employees, and vulnerable groups of workers, including domestic workers and migrant workers, could freely associate and form associations.

Workers who believed they were dismissed unlawfully could bring a case to court or lodge a complaint with the Labor Affairs Bureau (LAB) or the Commission against Corruption.

Government and employers did not respect collective bargaining and freedom of association. Government influenced the selection of association officials and interfered in the functioning of workers’ organizations. Penalties for violations of the law were not commensurate with those for other similar violations and were rarely applied.

In May President Wong Wai-man of the Bar Bending Industry Workers’ Union called off a small-scale May 1 Labor Day march due to soft and hard lobbying by police. Wong said he was accosted by plainclothes policemen for days after he notified police about the march, and some uniformed officers subsequently advised him to cancel the march to avoid it being “hijacked and politicized.” Within two days of Wong’s allegations, the secretary for security ordered the Judiciary Police to conduct a thorough investigation. On May 10, the Judiciary Police found that Wong’s allegation was unsubstantiated.

b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor

See the Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/.

c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment

The law prohibited all the worst forms of child labor. A law prohibited children younger than age 16 from working, although children ages 14 and 15 could work in “exceptional circumstances” if they obtained a health certificate to prove they had the “necessary robust physique to engage in a professional activity.” The law governing the number of working hours was equally applicable to adults and legally working children, but the law prohibited children from working overtime hours.

The law prohibited children younger than age 16 from certain types of work, including but not limited to domestic work, employment between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., and employment at places where admission of children was forbidden, such as casinos. The government required employers to assess the nature, extent, and duration of risk exposure at work before recruiting or employing a child. These regulations protected children from physically hazardous work, including exposure to dangerous chemicals, and jobs deemed inappropriate due to the child’s age.

The LAB was responsible for enforcing the law through periodic and targeted inspections and prosecutions but did so inconsistently. LAB operations were adequately resourced, but there were no prosecutions for labor trafficking and the Public Prosecutions Office did not convict any traffickers during the year.

Penalties for noncompliance with minimum wage law and child labor provisions fell under the labor ordinance and were financial; they were not comparable to those for other analogous serious crimes, such as kidnapping. If a child was a victim of forced labor, however, the penalties were commensurate with those for kidnapping. Penalties were regularly applied against violators.

There were no confirmed reports during the year of the worst forms of child labor.

d. Discrimination (see section 6)

e. Acceptable Conditions of Work

Wage and Hour Laws: Labor laws established the general principle of fair wages and mandated compliance with wage agreements. The SAR did not calculate an official poverty line, but the minimum wage was well above the World Bank’s poverty line. The law provided for a 48-hour workweek, an eight-hour workday, paid overtime, annual leave, health care, and maternity care. The law provided for a 24-hour rest period each week. All workers, whether under a term contract or an indefinite contract, were entitled to benefits including specified working hours, weekly time off, statutory holidays, annual leave, and sick leave. The law prohibited excessive overtime but permitted legal overtime (a maximum of eight hours per day and irrespective of workers’ consent) in force majeure situations or in response to external shocks, at the discretion of the employer. Overtime and wage laws were part of the labor ordinance, which was part of the civil code; penalties for their violation were exclusively financial penalty and were not commensurate with penalties for similar crimes, such as fraud, which was a criminal violation for which imprisonment could be ordered. The construction sector had the highest rate of overtime payment arrears or wage garnishments.

All workers, including migrants, had access to the courts in cases in which an employee was unlawfully dismissed, an employer failed to pay compensation, or a worker believed their legitimate interests were violated. If an employer dismissed staff “without just cause,” the employer had to provide economic compensation indexed to an employee’s length of service. In June a group of Filipino migrant workers won a civil case against their former employer, who was found guilty of nonpayment of wages and other offenses. The court awarded the workers almost 240,000 patacas ($30,000) in back pay.

The LAB provided assistance and legal advice to workers upon request, and cases of labor-related malpractice were referred to the LAB.

Occupational Safety and Health: The law required that employers provide a safe working environment. The LAB set industry-appropriate occupational safety and health (OSH) standards and enforced occupational safety and health regulations. Failure to correct infractions could lead to prosecution. Inspectors, and not the worker, were responsible for identifying dangerous working conditions.

The law allowed workers to remove themselves from hazardous conditions without jeopardy to their employment. The most hazardous sector of the SAR’s economy was the construction industry. In 2022 the LAB imposed fines of 6,500 patacas ($810) on two employers judged responsible for accidents that occurred due to discrepancies and irregularities in the work environment. The LAB also fined 29 employers a total of 195,500 patacas ($24,400) for failing to comply with workers’ compensation requirements. The LAB enforced OSH laws to ensure safe workplace conditions and standards at construction, commercial, and industrial sites. LAB enforcement officers conducted OSH compliance inspections on a regular basis, as well as unannounced visits to hazardous sites such as docks. Workers could make OSH complaints in person at six different service locations or anonymously by email, telephone, fax, or mail. LAB actively investigated OSH complaints.

Wage, Hour, and OSH Enforcement: The government effectively enforced minimum wage, overtime, and OSH laws. Penalties for violations were not specified in the labor ordinance, other than holding the employer liable and were, therefore, not commensurate with those for similar crimes, such as fraud and negligence. Penalties were regularly applied against violators. The number of labor inspectors was adequate to enforce compliance. Inspectors were authorized to conduct unannounced visits and levy sanctions, especially targeting construction sites where industrial accidents often occurred. Civil rights advocates criticized the minimum wage regime because it did not apply to nonresident domestic workers or persons with disabilities.

LAB encouraged employers to adhere to wage, hour, and OSH regulations through a variety of methods, particularly through close collaboration with casinos, the primary employers in the SAR.

Wage and hour regulations did not cover some vulnerable populations. For example, the minimum wage system did not apply to more than 100,000 migrant workers working in the SAR. Many OSH materials were only accessible in Chinese, which many migrant workers could not comprehend."

The two sides exchanged views on China-U.S. relations and issues of mutual interest.

Wang Yi elaborated on China’s principled position on developing China-U.S. relations, emphasizing that both sides should translate the important common understandings of the two presidents into concrete policies and actions. China hopes that the U.S. can view China with an objective, rational, and pragmatic attitude, formulate its policies toward China with the goal of peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation, engage with China in an equal, respectful, and mutually beneficial manner, and work with China to explore the right way for the two countries to get along well with each other in the new era.

Both sides agreed that the meeting is positive, pragmatic, and constructive. They agreed to step up communication and dialogue across various fields and at all levels, including the diplomatic channel, leverage the role of foreign services in advancing bilateral relations, and explore opportunities to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences."
100725,Ding Xuexiang Meets with Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson,"On July 10, 2025, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang met with former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson in Beijing.

Ding Xuexiang noted that not long ago, President Xi Jinping had a phone call with President Donald J. Trump at the latter's request, and the two heads of state reached important common understandings. Strengthening cooperation between China and the United States based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation is conducive to the sustained and sound development of China-U.S. relations, which can benefit both countries and the world. Stressing that China represents the greatest factor of certainty in today's turbulent world, Ding Xuexiang expressed the hope that the United States will correctly view China's development, respect China's core interests and major concerns, develop mutually beneficial and stable economic and trade relations, and jointly fulfill the responsibilities of major countries. He welcomes the Paulson Institute and U.S. enterprises to come to China for cooperation, and to play a positive role in promoting mutual trust and cooperation between China and the United States.

Henry M. Paulson said that the U.S.-China relations bear on global economic stability and development, and both sides should enhance communication and mutual trust. He expressed his willingness to play an active role in this regard."

260625,Wang Yi Meets with Professor from Harvard University of the United States Graham Allison,"On June 25, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with Professor from Harvard University of the United States Graham Allison in Beijing.

Wang Yi commended Graham Allison for his efforts to enhance mutual understanding between China and the United States and explore ways for the two countries to get along with each other. He said that Chinese people value the concept of ""seeking harmony without uniformity"", a traditional Eastern philosophy fundamentally different from the Western zero-sum mindset, which is characterized by a black-and-white and I-win-you-lose approach. It emphasizes achieving harmonious coexistence based on acknowledging and respecting differences, with the goal of fostering and expanding common interests among nations. China and the United States now need to develop a new narrative that can regulate future interactions between the two major countries.

Wang Yi said that the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forth by President Xi Jinping are the fundamental guidelines that China follows in handling affairs related to the United States. He expressed hope that the U.S. side will work with China to address the issue of mutual perception, which is fundamental to the China-U.S. relationship, just like the first button of a shirt that must be put right, and to find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other under the guidance of the three principles. He also expressed the hope that insightful people from all walks of life in the United States will play an active role in forming an objective and positive perception of China and promoting proper exchanges and interactions between China and the United States.

Graham Allison said that the concept of ""seeking harmony without uniformity"" shares common ground with the U.S. value of respecting diversity. The United States and China live on the same planet, with interests closely interlinked and futures deeply interlocked. Both sides should find a strategic positioning for coexistence to avoid falling into the ""Thucydides Trap"". This is crucial for both countries and the world. The United States and China should establish a new principled framework for the future development of bilateral relations, with mutual respect as the first principle. Graham Allison expressed his willingness to continue contributing to communication and exchanges between the two sides and the stable development of bilateral relations."
050625,President Xi Jinping Speaks with U.S. President Donald J. Trump on the Phone,"On the evening of June 5, President Xi Jinping took a phone call from U.S. President Donald J. Trump.

President Xi pointed out that recalibrating the direction of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations requires us to take the helm and set the right course. It is particularly important to steer clear of the various disturbances and disruptions. At the suggestion of the U.S. side, the two countries’ lead officials recently held an economic and trade meeting in Geneva. It marked an important step forward in resolving the relevant issues through dialogue and consultation, and was welcomed by both societies and the international community. It proved that dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice. The two sides need to make good use of the economic and trade consultation mechanism already in place, and seek win-win results in the spirit of equality and respect for each other’s concerns. The Chinese side is sincere about this, and at the same time has its principles. The Chinese always honor and deliver what has been promised. Both sides should make good on the agreement reached in Geneva. In fact, China has been seriously and earnestly executing the agreement. The U.S. side should acknowledge the progress already made, and remove the negative measures taken against China. The two sides should enhance communication in such fields as foreign affairs, economy and trade, military, and law enforcement to build consensus, clear up misunderstandings, and strengthen cooperation.

President Xi emphasized that the United States must handle the Taiwan question with prudence, so that the fringe separatists bent on “Taiwan independence” will not be able to drag China and America into the dangerous terrain of confrontation and even conflict. 

President Trump said that he has great respect for President Xi, and the U.S.-China relationship is very important. The U.S. wants the Chinese economy to do very well. The U.S. and China working together can get a lot of great things done. The U.S. will honor the one-China policy. The meeting in Geneva was very successful, and produced a good deal. The U.S. will work with China to execute the deal. The U.S. loves to have Chinese students coming to study in America.

President Xi welcomed President Trump to visit China again, for which President Trump expressed heartfelt appreciation. The two Presidents agreed that their teams should continue implementing the Geneva agreement and hold another round of meeting as soon as possible. "
030625,Wang Yi Meets with Newly-appointed Ambassador of the United States to China David Perdue,"On June 3, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met in Beijing with newly-appointed Ambassador of the United States (U.S.) to China David Perdue.

Wang Yi welcomed David Perdue to his new post and expressed hope that he will act as a reliable communicator, a mediator of differences, and a promoter of cooperation between China and the United States, and play a positive role in advancing the sound, steady and sustainable development of bilateral relations. Wang Yi stated that China-U.S. relations are now at an important and critical juncture. Looking back on the journey of nearly half a century, with all its ups and downs, since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the most important lesson is that equality and mutual respect are the prerequisites for exchanges between the two sides, and dialogue and cooperation remain the only correct choice.

Wang Yi emphasized that following the economic and trade meeting in Geneva, China has earnestly and strictly implemented the consensus reached by both sides. However, he expressed regret that the United States has recently introduced a series of negative measures based on groundless reasons, infringing upon China's legitimate rights and interests. China firmly opposes such actions. Wang Yi called on the United States to work with China in the same direction and earnestly implement the important common understandings reached during the phone call between the two heads of state in January this year, so as to create the necessary conditions for the return of China-U.S. relations to the right track.

David Perdue said that President Donald Trump holds great respect for President Xi Jinping, and that positive and constructive engagement between the two heads of state is very important. As the U.S. Ambassador to China, David Perdue expressed his willingness to maintain close communication with the Chinese side in the spirit of mutual respect and listening."
210525,Wang Yi Meets with President of the U.S. Asia Society Kyung-wha Kang,"On May 20, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with President of the U.S. Asia Society Kyung-wha Kang in Beijing.

Wang Yi said, China's policy toward the United States remains consistent and stable, and is always guided by the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping. Recently, progress has been made in the China-U.S. high-level meeting on economic and trade affairs, which once again proves that equal dialogue, mutual respect and proper handling of each other's legitimate concerns serve the common interests of both China and the United States. At the same time, however, the United States continues to suppress and contain China's legitimate right to development. Its recent move to seek a complete blockade on China's chips is a blatant act of unilateralism and bullying. China firmly opposes this.

Wang Yi said, major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics is rooted in China's 5,000-year-old civilization. It advocates for the practice of true multilateralism and open regionalism, aims to gather the greatest consensus for solidarity and cooperation, and works to address global challenges together. The Asia-Pacific region is where the common interests of China and the United States converge, and at the meantime, a focal area for their contradictions and differences. China and the United States should achieve positive interactions in the Asia-Pacific region first, thereby establishing a correct way for the two countries to get along with each other and finding effective channels for win-win cooperation. China appreciates the commitment of the Asia Society to enhancing dialogue, exchange and mutual understanding between China and the United States, and hopes that the Asia Society will continue to serve as a bridge to enhance the correct understanding of China among the American public.

Kyung-wha Kang said that the Asia Society has a deep understanding of China's millennia-old cultural heritage and is willing to continue sharing fact-based and objective views on China, and work with more insightful people in the United States to build platforms for dialogue to dispel misunderstandings and promote mutual understanding."

170425,Foreign Ministry Spokesperson’s Remarks on Announced Talks over the Iranian Nuclear Issue between the U.S. and Iran,"AFP: The U.S. and Iran have announced talks over the nature of Iran’s nuclear program. I’m wondering if the Chinese side has any response to that development?

Lin Jian: We noted relevant reports. China all along believes that the only right choice for settling the issue is through political and diplomatic means.

Against the current backdrop, it’s all the more important for parties to the Iranian nuclear issue to work in the same direction, strengthen dialogue and engagement, and avoid any escalation. As the country which unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and caused the current situation, the U.S. needs to show political sincerity, act in the spirit of mutual respect, engage in dialogue and consultation, and stop the threat of force and maximum pressure.

China will continue to maintain communication with relevant parties, actively promote talks for peace, and help relevant parties reach as early as possible a diplomatic settlement to the Iranian nuclear issue that accommodates all parties’ legitimate concerns so as to uphold the international non-proliferation regime and keep the Middle East peaceful and stable."
160425,Foreign Ministry Spokesperson’s Remarks on China Issuing Warrants for U.S. Agents in Cyber Attacks,"AFP: The Harbin Public Security Bureau said today they implicated 3 U.S. agents in cyber attacks during the Asian Winter Games earlier this year. I just wonder if the Ministry would like to comment on this case.

Lin Jian: We have noted the report, and have repeatedly made clear China’s position. During the 9th Asian Winter Games, the U.S. government launched cyber attacks on the information system of the Games and critical information infrastructure in Heilongjiang Province, causing grave harm to the security of China’s critical information infrastructure, national defense, finance, society, production and citizen’s personal information. China condemns the malicious cyber operations conducted by the U.S. government, which is truly egregious.

China has raised clear concerns to the U.S. through various means on its cyber attacks against China’s critical infrastructure. China urges the U.S. to adopt a responsible attitude on cybersecurity, stop conducting cyber attacks against China, and stop groundless vilification and attack against China. China will continue to take what is necessary to safeguard its own cybersecurity."
140425,Foreign Ministry Spokesperson’s Remarks on U.S. Media’s Distorted and False Report on China-US Cybersecurity Dialogue,"Global Times: According to a U.S. media report, in a 2024 December meeting on cybersecurity between China and the U.S., Chinese officials indicated that China was behind cyberattacks on the U.S. infrastructure, which resulted from the U.S. military backing of Taiwan. Trump administration officials said that the U.S. will pursue more aggressive cyber strikes against China. What is China’s comment on this?

Lin Jian: This news report is complete disinformation that distorts reality and seriously contradicts the facts.

On “Volt Typhoon”, China, on various occasions, has explicitly  rejected the groundless and unreasonable accusations from the U.S. and briefed the U.S. on relevant investigation reports by China’s cybersecurity agencies, uncovering the truth of the U.S. intelligence agency’s framing and smearing of China. China has made it clear to the U.S. on various occasions that China opposes U.S. abusing cyber issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs, and any U.S. attempt to use Taiwan to contain China is doomed to fail.

What needs to be stressed is that China has expressed clear concerns to the U.S. through various means regarding the U.S. administration authorizing the Department of Defense to conduct offensive cyber operations against other countries, U.S. cyberattacks against China’s critical infrastructure, and cyber military cooperation between the U.S. and Taiwan. China urges the U.S. to adopt a responsible attitude, so as to avoid miscalculation. China will take all necessary measures to safeguard its cybersecurity."
260325,Wang Yi Meets with Executive Vice Chair of NCUSCR Evan G. Greenberg,"On March 26, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with Executive Vice Chair of the National Committee on United States-China Relations (NCUSCR) Evan G. Greenberg in Beijing.

Wang Yi praised Evan G. Greenberg's long-term commitment to promoting China-U.S. communication and cooperation, and expressed the hope that the NCUSCR and people with vision from all walks of life in the United States will make new contributions to the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations.

Wang Yi said that China and the United States share extensive interests and broad prospects for cooperation, and can achieve mutual success to benefit the world. At present, China-U.S. relationship is at a critical juncture of where it is heading. Both sides should take the important common understandings and vision of the two heads of state as a guide, enhance communication, deepen mutual understanding, avoid misjudgments and manage differences. China is willing to engage in dialogue and consultation with the United States based on the principle of equality and in the spirit of mutual respect to address each other's legitimate concerns.

Evan G. Greenberg said that the U.S.-China relationship is the most significant bilateral relationship in the world. Both sides should leverage experience and wisdom to enhance understanding, expand cooperation and coexist harmoniously. In a world with increasing risk and uncertainties, both sides should step up engagement to fulfill the vision of the two heads of state and achieve peace and prosperity for each nation. Evan G. Greenberg affirmed that the NCUSCR and he himself will continue to make active efforts to that end."
230325,Li Qiang Meets with U.S. Senator Steve Daines and His Delegation,"On the afternoon of March 23, 2025, Premier Li Qiang of the State Council met with U.S. Senator Steve Daines and some American business people, who are in China to attend the China Development Forum 2025, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Li Qiang said that currently, the development of China-U.S. relations has reached a new critical juncture. In January this year, President Xi Jinping emphasized in a phone call with President Donald Trump that China and the United States have extensive common interests and broad space of cooperation, and can become partners and friends, contribute to each other's success, and advance shared prosperity for the good of the two countries and the whole world. History has proven that both China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Both sides should choose dialogue rather than confrontation, and choose win-win cooperation instead of a zero-sum game. Li Qiang expressed the hope that the United States will move further with China in the same direction, engage in candid communication and build trust and dispel misgivings in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, deepen practical cooperation, and make joint efforts to promote the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations.

Li Qiang pointed out that economic and trade cooperation is an important foundation of China-U.S. relations. Over the past few decades, the fruitful economic and trade cooperation achieved between China and the United States is the result of joint efforts of both sides and should be cherished. The more difficulties China-U.S. relations face, the more important it is to safeguard and develop China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, in a bid to continue injecting stability into bilateral relations. Trade wars produce no winners. No country can achieve development and prosperity through imposing tariffs, but only through openness and cooperation. Li Qiang called on the two sides to solve problems such as trade imbalance by making the pie of cooperation bigger and creating more incremental benefits. China always welcomes companies from all over the world, including the United States, to share development opportunities in China, and will actively address their legitimate demands, treat domestic and foreign-funded companies as equals, and continue to foster a sound business environment.

People from the U.S. side said that great changes have taken place in China in recent decades. U.S. companies actively participate in and support China's development, and are willing to continue investing in China, and strengthen dialogue and cooperation to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results and strive to promote the sustained development of bilateral relations.

What’s China’s comment on this?

Lin Jian: We reject the groundless U.S. accusations and urge the U.S. to immediately stop its wrongdoing of abusing sanctions. 

Last December, Chinese cybersecurity agency recently disclosed two cases of cyber attacks against Chinese high-tech companies launched by the U.S. intelligence community. The U.S. is the No.1 “hacking empire” in the world. We call on the U.S. to ditch its double standards and stop framing China."

Security Council high-level meeting in New York.

Wang Yi introduced the outcomes of the Security Council high-level meeting and the consensus reached by all parties, saying that addressing global challenges requires concerted efforts from the international community, and that practicing multilateralism calls for greater coordination among major countries. As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and the world's top two economies, China and the United States should follow the fundamental guidance of the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other. The two sides should explore ways to accomplish more significant, practical and beneficial outcomes for both countries and the world. Noting that China and the United States have extensive common interests and broad potential for cooperation, Wang Yi said that the two sides should earnestly respect each other's core interests, enhance communication, build mutual trust, eliminate interference, overcome obstacles, and work to improve and stabilize China-U.S. relations. China appreciates the efforts of representatives from U.S. business and strategic communities at the meeting to promote China-U.S. relations and mutual understanding, and hopes that they will play a constructive role in the sound and stable development of bilateral relations.

Wang Yi introduced the current positive trend in China's economy and the measures for further deepening all-round reform. He welcomes U.S. businesses to seize the new opportunities brought by Chinese modernization to achieve mutual benefit and win-win outcomes.

Representatives from the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Business Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among others, offered suggestions for strengthening U.S.-China cooperation to achieve early gains. The representatives said that maintaining stable U.S.-China relations benefits both countries and the world, and they will closely follow and welcome China's high-quality development, and will continue to increase investment in China."
190225,"Remarks by H.E. Wang Yi at the United Nations Security Council High-Level Meeting “Practicing Multilateralism, Reforming and Improving Global Governance”","Your Excellency Secretary General António Guterres,
Colleagues,

I would like to thank Secretary General Guterres for attending this meeting and for his briefing.

The year 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Eighty years ago, our forefathers, with strenuous struggle and tremendous sacrifice, won the great victory of the Anti-Fascist war; the international community drew painful lessons from the scourge of two world wars; and the United Nations was founded. Multilateralism gradually became the main trend of the times. New historical chapters were opened in global governance.

The past 80 years is a period of accelerated advancement in world multipolarity and economic globalization, a period that has witnessed people across the world forging ahead and meeting challenges together, and also a period during which the Global South has been rising and growing in strength. Meanwhile, although human society has emerged from the shadows of the Cold War and moved beyond the bipolar standoff, comprehensive peace and shared prosperity remain elusive. In the third decade of the 21st century, peace and development remains a long-term, arduous task.

The 80 years of history is enlightenment enough: In the face of the turbulent and changing international landscape, the U.N.-centered international system provides important safeguards for the cause of human progress, and the vision of multilateralism with coordination and cooperation as its cornerstone is the best solution to global issues. In the face of the historical trend of shared future, no country can prosper alone; mutually beneficial cooperation is the right choice. In the face of the profoundly changing international landscape, the Global South should not only achieve the historic feat of moving toward modernization together, but also remain at the forefront of improving the global governance system.

Mr. Secretary General,
Colleagues,

To chart our course for the future, we should not forget why we started out in the beginning. Today, transformation not seen in a century is accelerating across the world, geopolitical conflicts keep escalating, multiple crises are emerging, and instability and uncertainty are increasingly prominent. In a time of intensifying turbulence and transformation, we need, more than ever, to remind ourselves of the founding mission of the U.N., reinvigorate true multilateralism, and speed up the efforts to build a more just and equitable global governance system. In this connection, China proposes the following:

First, upholding sovereign equality. All countries are equal, regardless of size or strength. This is the foremost principle in the U.N. Charter. In advancing global governance, all countries have the right to participate as equals, make decisions as equals, and benefit as equals. We must respect the development paths chosen independently by people of all countries, uphold the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, and not impose one’s will upon others. We must practice international rule of law, ensure the effective implementation of international law, and reject double standards and selective application. Resolutions of the Security Council are binding, and should be observed by all countries. The Security Council is entrusted with authority, and such authority should be upheld by all countries. Any act of bullying, trickery or extortion is a flagrant violation of the basic norms of international relations. Any unilateral sanction that circumvents Security Council authorization lacks legal basis, defies justification and contradicts common sense.

Second, upholding fairness and justice. A critical part of global governance is to ensure that justice prevails. Since the end of World War II, a large number of countries in the Global South have emerged on the world stage, which has revealed growing incompatibility and irrationality in the global governance structure. Under the new circumstances, international affairs should no longer be monopolized by a small number of countries. Countries in the Global South have the right to speak up for and defend their legitimate rights and interests. The fruits of development should no longer be taken by just a few countries. People of all countries have the right to a happy life. The reform of the Security Council should continue to emphasize democratic consultation, increase the representation and say of developing countries, especially African countries, and effectively redress historical injustice.

Third, upholding solidarity and coordination. Promoting international cooperation is an important purpose of the U.N. Charter, and a sure path toward improving global governance. Countries should commit to the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, replace confrontation with coordination, prevent lose-lose through win-win cooperation, and break down small circles with greater solidarity. Members cannot just sit by and watch multilateral institutions become dysfunctional and ineffective due to their own failure to cooperate. The Security Council must rise above narrow-minded geopolitical considerations, champion the spirit of solidarity and cooperation, fulfill its duties conferred by the U.N. Charter, and effectually play its role for the maintenance of international peace and security.

Fourth, upholding an action-oriented approach. Global governance has to be improved, not through words but through actions. In the face of protracted wars, loss of innocent lives, and challenges brought by new technologies, U.N. agencies should seek solutions rather than chant slogans. The Pact for the Future was adopted at the Summit of the Future last September. It is important to follow that up with coordinated efforts of implementation, i.e. to turn the road map into a construction plan and a wonderful vision into substantive actions.

The situation in the Middle East remains fragile and tense. Gaza and the West Bank are the homeland of the Palestinian people, not a bargaining chip in political trade-offs. “The Palestinians governing Palestine” is an important principle that must be followed in the post-conflict governance of Gaza. It is vital to uphold the two-State solution, press for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question, and bring lasting peace and security to the Middle East.

The Ukraine crisis has dragged on and kept escalating for nearly three years. Recently, the pursuit of dialogue and negotiation has gained momentum. Since the start of the crisis, China has been calling for a political settlement and pushing for peace talks. China supports all efforts conducive to peace. In line with the four points about what must be done proposed by President Xi Jinping, we will continue to work with other countries, especially the Global South countries, to make more objective, balanced and rational voices heard, to build consensus for ending the conflict, and to pave the way for peace.

Mr. Secretary General,
Colleagues, 

Eighty years ago, Chinese representatives were the first to solemnly sign the U.N. Charter, writing with a Chinese calligraphy brush an important chapter in world history. Since the restoration of the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the U.N., we have remained steadfast in making China’s contribution to global governance. A community with a shared future for mankind, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative—the vision and initiatives put forth by President Xi Jinping represent China’s proposal for the reform and improvement of global governance. 

We pursue peace and security in global governance. As a major country with the best track record on peace and security, China is committed to following a path of peaceful development, to resolving disputes and differences by peaceful means, and to constructively promoting the settlement of hotspot issues. Chinese Blue Helmets have become a crucial force in U.N. peacekeeping operations, keeping the hope of world peace alive.

We advance common development in global governance. As the largest developing country in the world, China pursues high-quality development as a top priority and promotes high-standard opening up with firm resolve. It has become the major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions. China advocates a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization and promotes high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, as part of its contribution to the prosperity and development of countries around the world.

We champion openness and inclusiveness in global governance. As a time-honored civilization, China believes in harmony without uniformity, embraces inclusiveness, respects cultural diversity, and advocates humanity’s common values. China promotes exchanges, dialogue, and peaceful and harmonious coexistence among civilizations with a broad mind, in a bid to provide fresh impetus to the progress of human civilization.

We uphold multilateral cooperation in global governance. As a founding member of the United Nations, China takes the lead in following true multilateralism. China is a member of almost all universal intergovernmental organizations and a party to over 600 international conventions and their amendments. China supports the U.N. in playing a central role in international affairs and makes continuous contribution to the U.N. cause.

Mr. Secretary General,
Colleagues,

China in the new era is walking with big strides and confidence along the bright path of Chinese modernization. As it continues to make new progress, China will provide more opportunities for the modernization of the world. With the U.N. about to enter its next 80 years, China stands ready to work with all parties to draw wisdom from history, open a new era for multilateralism, and make global governance more fair and equitable.

Thank you."
270125,Xi Jinping Sends Chinese New Year Card in Return to Friends in U.S. State of Iowa,"On January 27, 2025, President Xi Jinping sent a Chinese New Year card in return to friends in U.S. State of Iowa. Xi Jinping said that 40 years ago when he visited the beautiful State of Iowa, he was warmly received by the people there, which is still fresh in his memory. China and the United States share extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation and can become partners and friends. China and the United States can help each other succeed and achieve common prosperity for the benefit of both countries and the world at large. Xi expressed his hope that the two peoples will pay more visits to each other and have more exchanges, jointly write new stories of friendship between the two peoples, and make new contributions to the development of China-U.S. relations.

Earlier, 58 people from Iowa of the U.S., including friends Luca Berrone, Gary Dvorchak and Sarah Lande, former U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad and his wife, former President of the World Food Prize Foundation Kenneth Quinn, as well as representatives of teachers, students and parents from Iowa who participated in the initiative of inviting 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs for a five-year period, jointly sent a Chinese New Year card to President Xi Jinping. In the card, the U.S. friends recalled President Xi Jinping's first visit to Iowa in 1985, and extended New Year wishes to President Xi Jinping for the Year of the Snake. The representatives of teachers, students and parents thanked President Xi Jinping for putting forward the initiative of ""50,000 in five years"", shared their feelings about visiting China, and expressed their expectations to visit China again."
240125,Wang Yi Has a Phone Call with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio,"On 24 January, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi had a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio upon request.

Wang Yi pointed out that President Xi Jinping had an important phone call with President Trump last Friday, during which they reached a series of common understandings. The development of China-U.S. relations has come to a new important juncture. President Xi comprehensively elaborated on China's policy toward the United States. President Trump made positive response, saying that he looks forward to maintaining good relations with President Xi and emphasizing that United States and China working together can solve many problems in the world.

Wang Yi said that the two heads of state have pointed out the direction and set the tone for China-US relations. Two teams need to implement their important common understandings and maintain communication, manage differences and expand cooperation in line with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, with a view to promoting the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations, and finding the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other in the new era.

Wang Yi said that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the choice of the Chinese people. China's development has a clear historical logic and is driven by strong internal dynamism. Our goal is to deliver a better life for the people and make more contributions to the world. We have no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone, but we must defend our legitimate right to development.

Wang Yi elaborated on China's principled position on the Taiwan question and urged the U.S. side to handle it prudently. Wang emphasized that Taiwan has been part of China's territory since ancient times, and we will never allow Taiwan to be split from China. The United States has made solemn commitments on abiding by the one-China policy in the three joint communiques, and it should not renege on them.

Rubio said the United States and China are two great countries. The U.S.-China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the 21st century and will determine the future of the world. The United States hopes to have candid communication with China, resolve differences, manage the bilateral relationship in a mature and prudent manner, and work together to address global challenges and maintain peace and stability in the world. The United States does not support “Taiwan independence” and hopes that the Taiwan question can be resolved peacefully in a manner acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

Wang Yi said that big countries should act in a manner befitting their status, shoulder their due international responsibilities, maintain world peace and help countries realize common development. I hope you will act accordingly and play a constructive role for the future of the people of China and the United States, as well as for the peace and stability of the world."
190125,MFA Coordinator for Cyber and Digital Affairs Wang Lei Takes an Interview with CCTV,"Question 1: US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said recently that the US had “sent clear messages to the PRC about what it would actually mean if they acted to disrupt American critical infrastructure and how we would respond”. What is China’s response?

A: We have told the Biden administration explicitly that China rejects US blame on China concerning specific cases without providing any evidence. We’ve also raised concerns to the US side that China has detected long-lasting, systemic and massive US cyber attacks against China, including cyber espionage, as well as cyber attacks that compromise the security of critical infrastructure in areas such as telecommunication, finance and transportation. We also briefed to the US side of the scope and basis of classification of critical information infrastructure according to China’s legislation, and highlighted our seriousness on protecting security of China’s critical infrastructure. We specifically underscored that the US should first set a good example before asking others to do things.

The key to address relevant issue is that the US should take China’s concerns seriously, and discard the wrong mindset that the loudest voices are the wisest. It will not work for other countries if the US tries to set rules unilaterally from “a position of strength”.

Question 2: Cybersecurity has become a hot-spot issue of China-US relations. How does China think China and the US should handle their existing disagreement? How will China-US cyber relationship evolve in the long run?

A: President Xi Jinping has repeatedly and profoundly pointed out that two big countries like China and the US should not cut off their ties or turn their back on each other, still less slide into conflict or confrontation, that the two countries should respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation, and China-US relationship should continue moving forward in a stable, sound and sustainable way. China is willing to build a future-oriented China-US cyber relationship in adherence with this spirit.

China and the US do have our differences in cyber arena. However, it is entirely possible for the two sides to discuss any matters of concern in an open and candid manner on the premise of equality and mutual respect while taking facts as basis and common rules as criterion. More importantly, we should think through the following questions from a broader and longer term of view: what kind of China-US cyber relationship we need to establish, what kind of rules we need to apply with when interacting with each other, and how we can work together to find the right way to get along well with each other in cyberspace?

China and the US are the two most influential countries in global cyber arena, and also the two countries that are most dependent on cyberspace. The two sides share similar concerns regarding ensuring cybersecurity, in particular the security of critical infrastructure. Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is not only in the common interests of both sides, but also should be our shared goal. China is willing to engage in dialogues with the US to build peaceful, stable and mutually respectful cyber relations, which we firmly believe is the best way to address common concerns of both sides in the long run, in spite of change of administrations of the US. "
170125,President Xi Jinping Speaks with U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump on the Phone,"On the evening of January 17, President Xi Jinping took a phone call from U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump.

President Xi congratulated Trump on his reelection as President of the United States. President Xi noted that they both attach great importance to their interactions, and both hope for a good start of the China-U.S. relationship during the new U.S. presidency. President Xi expressed his readiness to secure greater progress in China-U.S. relations from a new starting point.

President Xi stressed that the two great nations of China and the United States are pursuing their respective dreams, and are both committed to delivering a better life to their people. Given the extensive common interests and broad space of cooperation between the two countries, China and the United States can become partners and friends, contribute to each other’s success, and advance shared prosperity for the good of the two countries and the whole world.

President Xi pointed out that it is natural for two big countries with different national conditions to have some disagreements. The important thing is to respect each other’s core interests and major concerns, and find a proper solution. The Taiwan question concerns China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. side needs to approach it with prudence. The bilateral economic ties are essentially mutually beneficial and win-win. Confrontation and conflict should not be an option for the two countries. The two sides should follow the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, work more closely together, do more big, practical and good things that benefit the two countries and the world, and keep the two giant ships of China and the United States sailing forward along the route of steady, sound and sustainable development.

President-Elect Trump thanked President Xi for the congratulations, and said he values his great relations with President Xi. He hoped they would keep talking to each other, and looked forward to meeting with President Xi soon. As the most important countries in the world, the United States and China should get along well for years and beyond and work together for world peace.

191224,Wang Huning Meets with Professor from Harvard University of the United States Graham Allison,"On December 19, 2024, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Wang Huning met with Professor from Harvard University of the United States (U.S.) Graham Allison in Beijing.

Wang Huning said that under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese people are working together to advance Chinese modernization. China's domestic and foreign policies are consistent and aboveboard. President Xi Jinping put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and identified the four red lines that brook no challenge, namely, the Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China's path and system, and China's development right, providing fundamental strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations. China's policy toward the United States has remained consistent and stable. Noting that the Thucydides Trap is not a historical inevitability, he added that China and the United States should strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, help each other succeed through cooperation, and work together to cope with various global challenges.

Graham Allison said the United States and China should avoid falling into the Thucydides Trap, and finding the right way to get along with each other is important for both countries and the world at large. He expressed his willingness to continue promoting strengthened communication between both sides and contribute to the stable development of bilateral relations."
121224,Xi Jinping Sends Congratulatory Letter to U.S.-China Business Council Gala 2024,"On December 11, 2024, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) Gala 2024, in which he extended congratulations to the USCBC and all its members, and sincere greetings to people from all sectors of society in the United States (U.S.) who have long cared for and supported China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation.

Xi Jinping pointed out that China-U.S. relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world. It concerns not only the vital interests of the two peoples, but also the future of mankind. China and the United States stand to benefit from cooperation and lose from confrontation. The two countries should choose dialogue over confrontation and win-win cooperation over zero-sum games. China is ready to maintain communication with the United States, expand cooperation, manage differences, and continue exploring the right way for the two countries to get along with each other in the new era, so as to realize long-term peaceful coexistence between the two countries on this planet to the benefit of both countries and the world at large.

Xi Jinping stressed that China-U.S. economic and trade relations are an important part of bilateral relations. The interests of the two countries are closely intertwined, and the room for cooperation is infinitely vast. The two sides should properly handle differences through equal-footed consultation, and make the pie of cooperation bigger based on their complementary advantages. The success of one side should be an opportunity rather than a challenge for the other, and one's development should help rather than hinder the development of the other.

Xi Jinping pointed out that openness is a key driving force for human civilization and progress, and the only path toward prosperity and development for every country. Reform and opening up is a historic process in which China and the world achieve development and progress together. A few months ago, the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a comprehensive plan for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. China will always uphold the basic state policy of opening up to the outside world, keep improving its market-oriented, law-based, and world-class business environment for companies from all countries including the United States, and continue to liberalize and facilitate trade and investment. Chinese modernization, with its new achievements, will provide new opportunities for the world. Xi Jinping expressed the hope that USCBC and friends from all sectors will continue to care for and support China-U.S. relations, take an active part in Chinese modernization, join hands to write a new chapter of openness, cooperation and mutual benefit, and make new contributions to the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations.

On the same day, U.S. President Joe Biden also sent a congratulatory letter to the USCBC Gala 2024."
171124,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. President Joe Biden in Lima,"On the afternoon of November 16 local time, President Xi Jinping met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Lima.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs, but the two sides have also been engaged in dialogue and cooperation. The relationship has remained stable on the whole. Under the stewardship of the two Presidents, the two teams have worked out through consultations a number of guiding principles for China-U.S. relations. The two Presidents have jointly brought China-U.S. dialogue and cooperation back on track. More than 20 communication mechanisms have been restarted or established, and positive achievements have been made in such areas as diplomacy, security, economy, trade, fiscal affairs, finance, military, counternarcotics, law enforcement, agriculture, climate change, and people-to-people exchange.

President Xi underscored that it is worthwhile to review the experiences of the past four years and draw inspirations from them. He listed the following:

First, it is important to have a correct strategic perception. The Thucydides’s Trap is not a historical inevitability. A new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won. Containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail.

Second, it is important to match words with actions. A man cannot establish himself without credibility. China has always honored its words. If the U.S. side always says one thing but does another, it will be detrimental to its own image, and undermine trust between China and the United States.

Third, it is important to treat each other as equals. As two major countries, neither China nor the United States should seek to remodel the other according to one’s own will, suppress the other from the so-called “position of strength,” or deprive the other of the legitimate right to development so as to maintain its leading status.

Fourth, it is important not to challenge red lines and paramount principles. Contradictions and differences between two major countries like China and the United States are unavoidable. But one side should not undermine the core interests of the other, let alone seek conflict or confrontation. The one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués are the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. They must be observed. The Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China’s path and system, and China’s development right are four red lines for China. They must not be challenged. These are the most important guardrails and safety nets for China-U.S. relations.

Fifth, it is important to conduct more dialogue and cooperation. Under the current circumstances, common interests between China and the United States are expanding rather than shrinking. Their cooperation is crucial not only for the economy, trade, agriculture, counternarcotics, law enforcement and public health, but also for handling global challenges of climate change and artificial intelligence (AI) as well as addressing international hotspot issues. The two sides should expand the list of cooperation and make a bigger pie of cooperation to achieve a win-win result.

Sixth, it is important to respond to the expectations of the people. China-U.S. relations should always advance the well-being of the two peoples and bring them closer together. To facilitate personnel and cultural exchange, the two sides need to build bridges and roads, remove distractions and obstacles, and refrain from making any moves that have a chilling effect.

Seventh, it is important to step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. China and the United States should always keep in mind humanity’s future and their responsibilities for world peace, provide public good for the world, and act in a way conducive to global unity, including carrying out constructive interactions, refraining from mutual attrition, and not coercing other countries into taking sides.

President Xi stressed that the trajectory of China-U.S. relations has proved the validity of these experiences and inspirations from the past 45 years of diplomatic ties. When the two countries treat each other as partner and seek common ground while shelving differences, their relationship will make considerable progress. But if they regard each other as rival and pursue vicious competition, they will roil the relationship or even set it back. Humanity is faced with unprecedented challenges in this turbulent world suffering from frequent conflicts. Major-country competition should not be the underlying logic of the times; only solidarity and cooperation can help humanity overcome current difficulties. Neither decoupling nor supply-chain disruption is the solution; common development can only be achieved through mutually beneficial cooperation. “Small yard, high fences” is not what a major country should do; only openness and sharing can advance the well-being of humanity. A stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. China and the United States should keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other, realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet, and inject more certainty and positive energy into the world.

President Xi stressed that China’s goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China’s sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. China is ready to engage in dialogue, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the United States so as to sustain the hard-won momentum toward stability in China-U.S. relations.

President Xi stated China’s positions on Taiwan, economic and trade ties, science and technology, cybersecurity, the South China Sea, the Ukraine crisis and the Korean Peninsula.

President Xi stressed that cross-Strait peace and stability and “Taiwan independence” separatist activities are irreconcilable as water and fire. If the U.S side cares about maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait, it is crucial that it sees clearly the true nature of Lai Ching-te and the DPP authorities in seeking “Taiwan independence,” handles the Taiwan question with extra prudence, unequivocally opposes “Taiwan independence,” and supports China’s peaceful reunification.

The Chinese people’s right to development is not to be deprived of or ignored. While all countries need to safeguard their national security, they should not overstretch the national security concept, still less use it as a pretext for malicious moves to constrain and contain other countries.

There is no evidence that supports the irrational claim of the so-called “cyberattacks from China.” China itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.

China firmly upholds its territory, sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. Dialogue and consultation between states concerned is always the best way to manage differences in the South China Sea. The United States should not get involved in bilateral disputes over the relevant islands and reefs of Nansha Qundao, nor should it aid or abet the impulsion to make provocations.

China’s position and actions on the Ukraine issue have always been fair and square. China conducts shuttle diplomacy and mediation to promote peace talks, makes every effort for peace, and strives for deescalation. China does not allow conflict and turmoil to happen on the Korean Peninsula. It will not sit idly by when its strategic security and core interests are under threat.



President Biden stated that the U.S.-China relationship is the most important relationship in the world, not just for the two peoples, but also for the future of the world. The two governments have a responsibility to the two peoples and the world to see that competition does not veer into conflict. In the past four years, the two sides worked together to rebuild channels of communication. The two diplomatic and security teams have often had strategic communications and had candid and in-depth dialogue, which helped the two sides to better understand each other. Particularly since the San Francisco meeting a year ago, the two sides have made tangible progress on mil-to-mil relations, counternarcotics, law enforcement, AI, climate change and people-to-people exchange. The two sides support each other’s bid for hosting the APEC and G20 meetings respectively in 2026. This demonstrates what we can do for the two peoples when we work together. The United States does not seek a new Cold War, it does not seek to change China’s system, its alliances are not targeted against China, it does not support “Taiwan independence,” it does not seek conflict with China, and it does not see its Taiwan policy as a way to compete with China. The U.S. side will stay committed to the one-China policy. The United States is prepared to enhance communication and dialogue with China during the transition period to have a better perception of each other and responsibly manage the differences.

The two Presidents reiterated the seven-point common understandings on the guiding principles for China-U.S. relations, namely treating each other with respect, finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully, maintaining open lines of communication, preventing conflict, upholding the United Nations Charter, cooperating in areas of shared interest, and responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship. The two sides are ready to uphold these principles, continue to stabilize China-U.S. relations, and ensure a smooth transition of the relationship.

The two Presidents spoke positively about the important role of China-U.S. strategic communication, regular contact between the diplomatic and security teams, and dialogue mechanisms on mil-to-mil relations, economic and trade ties, and financial issues. They agreed to maintain the momentum in communication and strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination. The two Presidents reviewed the important progress in dialogue and cooperation on counternarcotics, climate change, AI, and people-to-people exchanges since their San Francisco meeting.

The two Presidents believed that the two sides have had candid and constructive dialogue on AI. The two sides co-sponsored each other’s resolutions at the U.N. General Assembly on AI. They affirmed the need to enhance international cooperation and promote AI for good for all. The two Presidents stressed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.

The two Presidents both believed that their meeting has been candid, profound and constructive. They expressed their willingness to stay in contact.

Cai Qi and Wang Yi attended the meeting."

Xi Jinping noted that history tells us that both countries stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation.

It is hoped that the two sides will, in the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and find the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other in the new era to the benefit of the two countries and the world.

161024,Xi Jinping Sends Congratulatory Letter to Gala Dinner 2024 of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations,"On October 15, 2024, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the Gala Dinner 2024 of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR).

Xi Jinping expressed appreciation for the unremitting efforts made by the NCUSCR to promote exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States in various fields, and extended congratulations to this year's Gala's esteemed honoree William E. Ford.

Xi Jinping pointed out that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relations in the world, bearing on the well-being of the two peoples and the future of mankind. China has always handled its relations with the United States based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and always believes that each country's success presents opportunities for the other. The two countries should serve as a boost to each other's development rather than a hindrance. China is willing to work with the United States as partners and friends, which will not only benefit the two countries but also the world at large.

Xi Jinping stressed that the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was successfully held in July this year, making systematic arrangements for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. Opening up is a defining feature of Chinese modernization, and China will only open its door even wider to the outside world. China will intensify institutional opening up, continue to build a world-class international business environment, and leverage its super-large market strength and domestic demand potential to create more opportunities for China-U.S. cooperation. Xi Jinping expressed the hope that the NCUSCR and friends from all sectors of society will continue to care about and support China-U.S. relations, continue to actively participate in China's modernization drive and benefit from it, increase visits and exchanges, constantly deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and work together to turn the San Francisco vision into reality, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples and inject more stability and positive energy into the world.

On the same day, U.S. President Joe Biden also sent a congratulatory letter to the annual Gala Dinner of the NCUSCR."
151024,Spokesperson’s Remarks on Report Revealing Truths of US Hyping up of “Volt Typhoon”,"Global Times: We noted China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, National Engineering Laboratory for Computer Virus Prevention Technology and the 360 Digital Security Group jointly released a report. It revealed that the US has been hyping up the so-called “Volt Typhoon” hacking group and blamed others to cover up cyberattacks it has launched. What’s China’s comment?

Mao Ning: I have also noted the report. Relevant institutions have released two reports before revealing that “Volt Typhoon” is in fact an international ransomware group, and that in order to receive more congressional budgets and government contracts, the US intelligence community and cybersecurity companies have been collaborating to spread disinformation and frame China. The newly-released report further exposed some staggering facts.

First, the US deployed advanced technical methods to frame other countries for launching cyberattacks. It inserted strings in other languages, such as Chinese, to mislead attribution analysis and frame other countries. It is noteworthy that Guam, which the US claimed to be the victim of “Volt Typhoon” cyberattacks, is actually the headquarter of a large number of cyberattacks against China and many Southeast Asian countries launched by the US.

Second, the US is using its advantages on undersea cables to launch massive, systemic cyber surveillance and espionage globally. Ironically, the US rallied some of its allies to issue a joint statement on the occasion of this year’s UN General Assembly, claiming to safeguard the security and resilience of undersea cables.

Third, the US has never stopped cyber theft against its allies, including Germany. In 2022, the US and Europe have established a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, and the US promised to enhance oversight of cyber surveillance activities in Europe in exchange for Europe’s consent to transmitting data to the United States. The US used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to compel major US internet companies to provide access to user data from their servers, and launched indiscriminate surveillance program and data theft against internet users from Germany and other places in the world.

Fourth, some US tech firms have become accomplices of the US government. The US on the one hand smears that other countries have pre-positioned access to launch cyberattacks. Yet on the other hand, the US has pre-positioned access points into Internet equipment products with the help of large Internet companies or equipment suppliers to attack supply chains worldwide. Some tech firms have actively involved themselves in spreading the false narrative about so-called Chinese hacking in order to get more interests .

The facts revealed in the report once again show who is the biggest threat to global cyberspace security. So far, the US government not only turned a blind eye to the report, but also continued to spread disinformation including “Volt Typhoon.”

China condemns such irresponsible moves by the US, and urges the US to immediately stop its cyberattacks globally and stop smearing China by using cybersecurity issues."

290924,Building on Past Achievements and Forging Ahead Together Toward a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind,"Mr. President,
Colleagues,

Today, humanity has once again come to a historical crossroads. We are facing a changing and turbulent world. Challenges of insecurity, imbalanced development and ineffective governance are increasingly prominent. Hotspot conflicts, major-country confrontation and geopolitical tensions keep emerging. The future of this planet is becoming a cause for growing concern. Meanwhile, we are also embracing a world full of hope. Multipolarity and globalization have become the unstoppable trend of our times. The aspirations of the Global South nations for modernization has never been stronger. Our stride toward modernization has never been more steadfast.

This institution, the United Nations, embodies the aspirations of people across the world for lasting peace and common prosperity, and bears witness to the glorious journey of the international community coming together in pursuit of progress. President Xi Jinping stressed on multiple occasions that the role of the U.N. should be strengthened, not weakened. Amid global transformation not seen in a century, what China calls for is to follow the trend of the times, keep to the direction of human progress, and make the right choices of history. What China proposes is to uphold peaceful coexistence and put in place a security architecture that ensures enduring stability; uphold openness and inclusiveness and foster a development paradigm that promotes shared prosperity; uphold harmony without uniformity and adopt an approach to civilizations that promotes exchange and mutual learning; and uphold fairness and justice and develop a governance structure that pools strengths for shared benefit.

In today’s world, the security of all countries is tied together. In face of various kinds of global challenges and risks, no one can stay immune or enjoy security alone. Countries need to be guided by a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, take the legitimate security concerns of others seriously, and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should actively explore a path for major countries to coexist in peace, and work for a new type of international relations characterized by mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation.

In today’s world, the development of all countries is deeply integrated. If the rich get richer while the poor remain poor, then “everyone is born equal” would become an empty slogan, and fairness and justice would be even more elusive. Achieving modernization is a legitimate right of the people of all countries, not a prerogative of a few. We should be committed to advancing global modernization, and ensure that no one and no country is left behind on the journey toward modernization. We should advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive globalization, unequivocally oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and help developing countries leap over the development divide, to maintain the vitality of global economic growth.

In today’s world, each civilization has its own strengths. President Xi Jinping pointed out that there is no such thing as a superior or inferior civilization, and civilizations are different only in identity and location. We should respect the diversity of civilizations, and strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning. We should advocate humanity’s common values, namely, peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, refrain from conducting values-oriented diplomacy, and oppose ideology-based confrontation. We should respect each other as equals, and help each other succeed with an inclusive mind.

In today’s world, countries should all enjoy sovereign equality. As a large number of Global South nations are growing with a strong momentum, gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything. We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world, and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system. We should practice true multilateralism, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and make international relations more democratic. We should follow the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and make global governance more just and equitable.

Mr. President,

Peace is the most precious thing in our world today. You may wonder if there is a path leading to peace. In fact, peace is the path. Without peace, development will not sustain; without peace, cooperation cannot happen. For the sake of peace, a single ray of hope is reason enough not to give up; the slightest chance deserves a hundredfold effort.

An end to the Ukraine crisis remains elusive. The top priority is to commit to “no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party,” and push for deescalation of the situation as soon as possible. China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains. At this session of the General Assembly, China, Brazil and other Global South countries have jointly launched the group of Friends for Peace. Its very purpose is to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, build consensus for a political settlement of the crisis and contribute to a prospect of peace.

The question of Palestine is the biggest wound to human conscience. As we speak, the conflict in Gaza is still going on, causing more civilian casualties with each passing day. Fighting has spread to Lebanon; might must not take the place of justice. Palestine’s long-held aspiration to establish an independent state should not be shunned anymore, and the historical injustice suffered by the Palestinian people should not be ignored any longer. There must not be any delay in reaching a comprehensive ceasefire, and the fundamental way out lies in the two-State solution. China has always been a staunch supporter of the just cause of the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights, and a staunch supporter of Palestine’s full U.N. membership. We have recently helped to bring about breakthroughs in intra-Palestine reconciliation, and will continue to work in concert with like-minded countries for a comprehensive and just settlement of the question of Palestine and durable peace and security in the Middle East.

The issue of Afghanistan concerns regional peace and security. It is important to help Afghanistan exercise prudent governance, fight terrorism effectively, improve people’s life and reinvigorate the economy, to open up a better future for the Afghan people.

The Korean Peninsula should not experience war again. The important thing is to make persistent effort for deescalation, commit to seeking solutions through dialogue and consultation, realize a transition from the armistice to a peace mechanism, and safeguard peace and stability on the Peninsula.

China is deeply aware that Asia needs stability and development and opposes division and conflict. As an important origin of human civilization and a key engine of global growth, Asia has the wisdom and capability to stabilize the situation through regional cooperation and handle differences properly through dialogue and consultation. We are firmly against the meddling by countries outside the region, and will resolutely resist attempts by any force to stoke trouble and confrontation in the region.

Mr. President,

As the world faces increasingly serious challenges, China has never opted to be an indifferent spectator. Instead, we have been playing a bigger part in global governance than ever before. President Xi Jinping has put forth the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative in recent years. They carry China’s wisdom for resolving various difficult issues confronting humanity, and bring impetus from China for improving global governance.

In the face of uneven and inadequate global development, China’s proposal is to put development at the top of the global agenda, focus on delivering the Sustainable Development Goals of the U.N. 2030 Agenda, increase input in development, and help developing countries better respond to different risks and challenges. At the recent Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, President Xi Jinping outlined 10 partnership actions to be taken together with Africa to advance modernization, and announced the decision to give over 40 LDCs, including those in Africa, zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. China is the first major developing country and the first major economy to take such a significant step.

In the face of unilateral, bullying acts such as sanctions and blockade, China firmly supports countries in defending their legitimate rights, upholding the equity and openness of the international system, making global development more coordinated and beneficial for all, and jointly opposing technology blockade and rejecting decoupling or severing supply chains. Sanctions and pressure will not bring monopolistic advantages. Suppressing and containing others will not solve problems at home. The right of people of all countries to pursue a better life should not be taken away. Here, we once again urge the United States to completely lift its blockade, sanctions and terrorism-related designation against Cuba.

In the face of aggravating ecological challenges, China is firmly committed to a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development. We will move from carbon peaking to carbon neutrality in the shortest time span in world history, contributing China’s efforts to harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature. At the global level, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and the Paris Agreement must be implemented in earnest. Developed countries should assist developing countries in building their capacity to cope with climate change. Touting the need of climate response while suppressing the green industries of others will only hold back global progress in green transition.

In the face of burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI), China is committed to taking a people-centered approach, developing AI for good, and putting equal emphasis on development and security. We are working to explore and establish widely-recognized international rules and standards. China supports the U.N.’s role as the main channel for global AI governance and is committed to strengthening international cooperation on AI capacity-building. China has put forth the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, and is ready to make more contributions to the sound, orderly, fair and inclusive development of AI.

In the face of the task of human rights protection, China maintains that all countries’ right to independently choose their path of human rights development should be respected. No country should impose its own will on others, or arbitrarily interfere in others’ internal affairs citing human rights as an excuse. In human rights protection, China is committed to putting people first and promoting the free and well-rounded development of the people. We have found a path of human rights development that suits China’s national conditions. China is ready to engage in dialogue and exchanges with all countries and U.N. human rights bodies on an equal footing, and jointly promote the sound development of the global human rights cause.

Mr. President,

Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. This is the history and the reality. Both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China, and this constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Right here in this august hall 53 years ago, the 26th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, deciding to restore all the rights of the People’s Republic of China at the U.N., to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the U.N., and to expel forthwith the representatives of the Taiwan region from the U.N. and all the organizations related to it. Once and for all, the resolution resolved the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the U.N. It made clear that there is no such thing as “two Chinas,” or “one China, one Taiwan.” On this matter of principle, there is no gray zone or room for ambiguity. The complete reunification of China will be achieved. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one and no force can stop.

Mr. President,

In a few days’ time, the People’s Republic of China will celebrate the 75th anniversary of its founding. Over the past 75 years, no matter how the world changes, China’s dedication has not changed. It is dedicated to pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is also dedicated to human progress and world harmony. In the course of seeking its own development, China has kept in mind the common interests of the whole world, generating new opportunities for the world through its own development. Not long ago, the Third Plenum of the 20th CPC Central Committee made an important decision on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. It set in motion a new journey where China joins hands with the world in common development and progress.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to world peace and stability. The Chinese culture values peace, and the Chinese nation has no tradition of external expansion. China, once a victim of foreign power bullying, knows full well the value of peace and the hard-won gains of development. In fact, China is the only major country that has written peaceful development into its constitution, and the only country among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge no-first-use of nuclear weapons. We are actively exploring and putting into practice the Chinese way of addressing hotspot issues, boosting the prospects for resolving the security dilemma and improving security governance, and paving the ground for conflict settlement and peacebuilding. Every step in China’s development is an increase in the force for peace.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to the common development for all. China does not only care about its own development. We are ready to develop hand in hand with all countries. By further expanding high-standard opening up, China is aligning proactively with high-standard international economic and trade rules to foster a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment. China has realized full mutual visa exemption with many countries, and is expanding its unilateral visa waiver program to facilitate two-way personnel flows. China is vigorously promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, a concrete step to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China will also speed up the implementation of the eight measures in support of Global South cooperation and the series of initiatives supporting Africa’s peace and development, in order to help countries in the Global South stride toward modernization.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to improving global governance. China has been an abiding supporter of the U.N.’s continued reform and development to bring about a modernized “U.N. 2.0.” The international financial system needs to be more fit for the times and global governance should be more balanced and effective. China will continue to fulfill its international obligations, provide financial support and send our best minds to the United Nations. The U.N. system needs to respond to the legitimate calls of developing countries and increase the representation and voice of those in the Global South.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to the advancement of human civilization. Chinese modernization is rooted in China, but has also drawn on the achievements of other civilizations. It has created a new form of human advancement, and provided a new choice to other countries in exploring modernization paths. China believes that different civilizations should respect and learn from one another, and jointly contribute to the progress of human civilization. China has proposed the setting up of an International Day for Dialogue among Civilizations. We call for more people-to-people exchanges and cooperation across the world, to strengthen mutual understanding and amity among people of all countries.

Mr. President,

Next year will mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of this very Organization. China stands ready to work with all countries to renew the founding purposes and mission of the U.N., reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the U.N. Charter, advocate and practice true multilateralism, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and jointly usher in a better world.

Thank you."
280924,Wang Yi Meets with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On September 27, 2024 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken upon request on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Wang Yi pointed out that under the strategic guidance of the two Presidents, China-U.S. relations have, amid twists and turns, returned to Bali and reached San Francisco. Such progress is hard-won and should be cherished. The stabilization of China-U.S. relations serves the interests of the two peoples and meets the expectation of the international community. Whether or not this momentum can be sustained depends on the efforts of both sides. The United States should not always approach China with two faces: On the one hand encircling and suppressing China brazenly, and on the other hand, having dialogue and cooperation with China as if nothing is wrong. Since the United States has expressed multiple times that it has no intention to have conflict with China, then fundamentally, it needs to establish a rational perception of China, and find the right way to get along with it. The United States needs to carry out dialogue with respect, advance cooperation in the spirit of reciprocity, and address differences with great prudence, rather than act willfully as it sees fit from a position of strength or use previous mistakes as excuses to make more mistakes.



Wang Yi underscored that the intensifying ""Taiwan independence"" activities by Lai Ching-te and others pose the greatest danger to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. ""Taiwan independence"" and cross-Strait peace are irreconcilable. If the United States truly hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle, implement the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, stop arming Taiwan, publicly oppose ""Taiwan independence,"" and support the peaceful reunification of China.

Wang Yi said that China is firmly opposed to U.S. suppression in trade and technology. National security should not be politicized, and ""small yard, high fence"" should not become ""big yard, iron curtain."" China will never accept finger-pointing by human rights preachers, still less interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. People-to-people exchanges between the two countries are very important, and the United States should remove obstacles with real actions.

Wang Yi articulated China's firm position on the South China Sea issue. He stressed that China remains committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation with countries directly concerned. The United States should not stir up trouble in the South China Sea, or undermine regional countries' efforts to safeguard peace and stability there.

Wang Yi noted that China's position on the Ukraine issue is aboveboard. It has been committed to promoting talks for peace and has been making its efforts toward peaceful settlement. The United States should stop smearing, scapegoating and arbitrarily imposing sanctions on China, and stop using this issue to create antagonism and incite camp-based confrontation.

The two sides agreed that the meeting was candid and substantive, and that China and the United States need to find a way to live alongside one another in peace in the indefinite future. The two sides will continue to implement the important common understandings of the two Presidents in San Francisco, engage in dialogue and cooperation, and properly manage differences to work toward stable, healthy and sustainable development of bilateral relations.

The two sides agreed to maintain communication on international and regional hotspot issues, and hold a new round of consultations on Asia-Pacific affairs in due course."
270924,"Working Together for Peace, Development and a Brighter Future for BRICS","Dear colleagues,

It is a great pleasure to meet you all in New York.

The current international situation is marked by change and instability, and the world is experiencing disorder, slowing growth, uneven development, and a loss of focus in governance. The theme of this year’s General Debate—“Leaving no one behind”—highlights the widely shared aspiration for greater equality, security and prosperity in our world. As leading members of the Global South, we BRICS countries should pursue our own success while promoting the greater good, and make our contribution to an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.

—We should promote common security and strive for lasting peace. In today’s world where countries are dependent on each other, humanity live in an inseparable community of security. No country has the right to manipulate the global security agenda or seek its own security at the expense of others. It is important that we make good use of such BRICS mechanisms as the Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs / International Relations and the Meeting of National Security Advisers and High Representatives on National Security to strengthen coordination on international and regional hotspots and make a joint response to the various challenges we face. On Ukraine, we should uphold the principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fanning the flames by any party, and encourage dialogue and negotiation for the settlement of the crisis. The six-point common understanding jointly released by Brazil and China to this end has received varying degrees of positive response from over 100 countries. On Palestine, China stands firmly with Arab countries. We must push for the early realization of a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza, support Palestine’s full U.N. membership, and implement the two-State solution, in a bid to bring enduring peace to the Middle East.

—We should stay focused on development as a priority and remove hinderance to development. Development is an eternal pursuit of humanity and a major yardstick of the progress of times. The Global Development Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping has received active support from the U.N. and a vast number of developing countries. BRICS should harness its strengths to drive development to the center of the U.N. agenda, stay attentive to the difficulties facing developing countries, urge developed countries to honor their promises, and give a stronger boost to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is important to keep in mind the urgent needs of developing countries in poverty reduction, development financing, and energy and food security, and seize the opportunities presented by the technological revolution and industrial transformation to foster new drivers for high-quality development.

—We should follow true multilateralism and improve global governance. When multilateralism is under attack, the world will be in disarray. When hegemonic and bullying acts run unchecked, human civilization will revert to the law of the jungle. It is important that we firmly defend the international system with the U.N. at its core, uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and reject a selective application of these purposes and principles. We could take the follow-up to the Summit of the Future as a chance to advance the reform of the international financial architecture, support countries of the South in participating fully in international economic decision-making, governance and rules-making, and increase their voice and representation. “Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-Building of Artificial Intelligence,” the resolution cosponsored by China and many other countries of the South, has been overwhelmingly adopted at the General Assembly. We welcome BRICS countries on board for its implementation so that more developing countries can benefit from it.

Colleagues,

Next month, BRICS will hold its first summit following its membership expansion. All eyes will be on this highly significant meeting. We should support Russia’s chairmanship, and take the summit as an opportunity to send a strong message of upholding fairness and justice and promoting common development. We could strive for new milestone outcomes in such areas as finance, AI, and energy and minerals to get the greater  BRICS cooperation off to a good start. We should also step up efforts to set up the Partner Country category, which is a consensus reached by BRICS leaders at the Johannesburg Summit last year and a mission we must accomplish. We need to keep the door open to new members, so as to provide more vigor and drive to the development of BRICS.

Colleagues,

Not long ago, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its third plenary session. At the session, a new blueprint was drawn up to further advance Chinese modernization. As China pursues high-standard opening up and high-quality development, we will continue to view fellow BRICS countries as good companions and good partners. China will share development opportunities with BRICS countries and other countries around the world and seek more cooperation in building a community with a shared future for mankind.

Thank you."
250924,"Peng Liyuan Attends China-U.S. Teenager Cultural and Sports Exchange Event Entitled ""Shared Journey for China-U.S. Friendship""","On the afternoon of September 24, 2024, Peng Liyuan, wife of President Xi Jinping, attended the China-U.S. Teenager Cultural and Sports Exchange Event entitled ""Shared Journey for China-U.S. Friendship"" at Beijing No. 8 High School.

Peng Liyuan had a warm interaction with the teenager delegation from Washington State, the United States. She welcomed the teachers and students to visit, know about and experience the real China firsthand, and expressed the expectation for more mutual understanding and interaction between teenagers from China and the United States to inject positive energy into China-U.S. relations.



Peng Liyuan, together with the Chinese and foreign guests, watched a friendly basketball match between Chinese and U.S. teenagers, and she presented commemorative medals to players from both teams. The student cheerleading squads from both countries performed vibrant aerobics, earning rounds of applause from the audience.





Peng Liyuan watched a video of the U.S. teenager delegation's visit to China. The U.S. student representatives enthusiastically shared their unforgettable experiences and impressions from visiting various provinces and cities in China, learning about different ethnic customs, and experiencing outstanding traditional Chinese culture. Logic Seven Allah-Amen, Assistant Principal at Lincoln High School, fondly recalled hosting the visit of President Xi Jinping and Professor Peng Liyuan to the school in 2015, and sincerely thanked President Xi Jinping for his care and support for exchanges between the teenagers of both countries. He also expressed willingness to actively contribute to promoting a closer bond between the two peoples. Noting that the rich and colorful visit has helped forge a deep friendship between teenagers of the two countries, Peng Liyuan expressed the belief that the visit will leave a beautiful memory in their hearts. As the future of China-U.S. relations lies in the youth, Peng Liyuan expressed her hope that the delegation will share their experiences and insights in China with their families, friends and classmates upon returning to their homeland, pass on the friendship of the Chinese people, and keep the tree of friendship between Chinese and U.S. people blossoming.



At last, the Chinese and American teenagers sang Chinese and English songs in unison, and Peng Liyuan took a cordial group photo with students from both countries. The atmosphere was warm and friendly.





In November 2023, President Xi Jinping announced in San Francisco in the United States that ""China is ready to invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years."" This time, nearly 100 teachers and students from more than 10 high schools in Washington State visited China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries."
290824,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan,"On the afternoon of August 29, President Xi Jinping met with Assistant to the U.S. President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

President Xi pointed out that in this changing and turbulent world, countries need solidarity and coordination, not division or confrontation. People want openness and progress, not exclusion or regress. As two major countries, China and the United States should be responsible for history, for the people and for the world, and should be a source of stability for world peace and a propeller for common development.

President Xi stressed that when China and the United States, two major countries, engage with each other, the No.1 issue is to develop a right strategic perception, and they need to first and foremost find a good answer to the overarching question: Are China and the United States rivals or partners? China’s foreign policy is open and transparent and its strategic intentions are aboveboard, both of which have been highly consistent and stable. China is focused on managing its own affairs well and will continue deepening reform comprehensively to further improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics that suits China’s national conditions. China follows a path of peaceful development. While realizing its own development, China is also ready to work with other countries for common development, and to jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind.

President Xi pointed out that China’s U.S. policy is highly consistent. While great changes have taken place in the two countries and in China-U.S. relations, China’s commitment to the goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged, its principle in handling the relationship based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation remains unchanged, its position of firmly safeguarding the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged, and its efforts to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people remain unchanged. President Xi expressed the hope that the United States will work in the same direction with China, view China and its development in a positive and rational light, see each other’s development as an opportunity rather than a challenge, work with China to find a right way for China and the United States, two countries with different civilizations, systems and paths, to coexist in peace and achieve common development on this planet, and work to maintain the stability of China-U.S. relations and, on that basis, improve and take forward the relationship.



National Security Advisor Sullivan conveyed the regards of President Biden to President Xi, and thanked President Xi for meeting him. He said that since the San Francisco summit meeting between the two presidents, the two sides have earnestly implemented their common understandings and achieved positive progress. This round of strategic communication with Director Wang Yi in China was in-depth, candid, substantive and constructive. He reiterated that the United States does not seek a new Cold War, it does not seek to change China’s system, the revitalization of U.S. alliances is not against China, the United States does not support “Taiwan independence,” and it does not seek conflict with China. The one-China policy of the United States has not changed, and it has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to contain China. The United States hopes to maintain strategic communication with China and find a way for the United States and China to coexist in peace and for U.S.-China relations to develop in a sustainable way. President Biden looks forward to having communication again with President Xi soon.

President Xi asked National Security Advisor Sullivan to pass on his regards to President Biden. President Xi expressed readiness to stay in touch with President Biden to guide and steer the development of China-U.S. relations.

Wang Yi attended the meeting"
280824,Wang Yi and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Hold Strategic Communication,"From August 27 to 28, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi held a new round of strategic communication with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Beijing. The two sides had candid, substantive and constructive discussions.

Wang Yi said, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs. Reviewing the experiences and lessons from these fluctuations can help forge a better future and find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other.

First, to keep China-U.S. relations on the right track, the key is to rely on the guidance of the two heads of state. The two sides should uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation and implement the common understandings reached between the two heads of state to promote the stable, sound and sustainable development of bilateral relations.

Second, to avoid conflict and confrontation between China and the United States, the key is to adhere to the three China-U.S. joint communiques. The political foundation for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries must be maintained. China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its political system and development path, and the legitimate right to development of the Chinese people must be respected.

Third, to ensure smooth China-U.S. interactions, the key is to treat each other as equals. Acting from a position of strength is not the right way of interaction between countries.

Fourth, the key to pursuing the steady, sustained development of China-U.S. relations is cementing public support. The two countries should build more bridges and pave more roads for people-to-people exchange, rather than raising obstacles.

Fifth, to achieve peaceful coexistence between China and the United States, the key is to establish correct perception. China is committed to ensuring better lives for its people at home, and to making greater contributions to world peace and development. The United States should not speculate about China based on its own historical path, nor should it assume that China will follow the path taken by past world powers that sought hegemony.



Wang Yi briefed Jake Sullivan on the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and stressed that the meeting marks a new milestone in China's reform and opening-up, providing a new window for the outside world to understand China and new opportunities for the common development of all countries.

Wang Yi stressed that Taiwan belongs to China and that China will be reunited. ""Taiwan independence"" poses the biggest risk to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The United States should act on its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"", adhere to the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, stop arming Taiwan, and support the peaceful reunification of China.

Wang Yi pointed out that national security should be common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, and one country's security should not be built upon the insecurity of others. National security requires clear boundaries, particularly in the economic domain, where they must be scientifically defined. Wang Yi urged the United States to end its suppression of China in the economic, trade and sci-tech fields, and refrain from undermining China's legitimate interests. Using ""overcapacity"" as an excuse to pursue protectionism will only harm global green development and impede world economic growth.

Wang Yi stressed that China is firm in upholding its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests over the Nanhai Zhudao (South China Sea islands), as well as the seriousness and efficacy of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. The United States must not undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity under the pretext of bilateral treaties, nor should it support or condone the Philippines' acts of infringement.



Jake Sullivan said that there are differences and competition between the United States and China, but also many areas where cooperation is needed. He noted that the United States agrees that the two countries should treat each other as equals and that competition should be healthy and fair, and said the U.S. side has no intention of decoupling from China. The United States adheres to the one-China policy and does not support ""Taiwan independence"", ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"". The United States and China will coexist peacefully on this planet for a long time, and the goal of U.S. policy is to find a way to make the U.S.-China relationship sustainable. The U.S. side is willing to continue maintaining strategic communication with China to enhance mutual understanding and reduce misunderstanding and miscalculation.

The two sides also had an exchange of views on issues concerning Ukraine, the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula. Reiterating that China is always committed to promoting peace talks and pushing for a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, Wang Yi said that China will continue to do the right thing. The United States should not shift responsibility to China, even less impose illegal, unilateral sanctions.

The two sides discussed a new round of interactions between the two heads of state in the near future. The two sides agreed to continue implementing the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state at their San Francisco summit meeting, and maintain high-level exchange and communication at all levels. They also agreed to continue carrying out cooperation on drug control, law enforcement, the repatriation of illegal immigrants and climate change response. The two sides agreed on institutional arrangements such as a video call between theater leaders of the two militaries, and the second round of China-U.S. governmental talks on AI at an appropriate time."
250824,MFA official's briefing on U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's visit to China,"The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced on Saturday that Assistant to the U.S. President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) Jake Sullivan will visit China from August 27 to 29 at the invitation of Wang Yi, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, to hold a new round of China-U.S. strategic communication. In a press briefing on Sunday, the leading official of MFA's Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs gave further information and took questions from the media.

The leading official said that holding strategic communication between the Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission Office and the National Security Advisor to the U.S. President was an important consensus reached between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at their Bali meeting in November 2022. Since the meeting, Director Wang Yi and NSA Sullivan have held three rounds of strategic communication in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok respectively, all of which were substantive and constructive, and produced good results. Both sides agreed to continue making good use of this channel of strategic communication.

The upcoming visit will also be the first visit to China by a National Security Advisor to the U.S. President after eight years, and the first visit to China by NSA Sullivan. It is an important step for the two sides to implement the common understandings the two presidents reached at their San Francisco meeting. After San Francisco, the diplomatic, financial, law enforcement and climate teams and the militaries of the two sides have maintained communication, and the exchanges between the two peoples have increased. Meanwhile, the United States has kept containing and suppressing China. And China has taken resolute countermeasures. The China-U.S. relationship is still at a critical juncture of being stabilized.

Against this backdrop, Director Wang Yi will have an in-depth exchange of views with NSA Sullivan on China-U.S. relations, sensitive issues, and major international and regional hotspots. The two sides will jointly take stock of the progress made by the two countries in implementing the common understandings of the two presidents in San Francisco, give full play to the 20-plus dialogue and communication mechanisms that have been established or resumed, and continue to discuss the issue of strategic perception and the boundary between national security and economic activities. The Chinese side will focus on raising serious concerns, articulating its position and laying out serious demands on issues related to the Taiwan question, the right to development and China's strategic security. The Taiwan question is the first and foremost red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations, and ""Taiwan independence"" is the biggest risk to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. side must abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and honor its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence."" The U.S. side's continuous arbitrary measures against China in the areas of tariffs, export control, investment review and unilateral sanctions seriously undermine China's legitimate rights and interests. China demands that the U.S. side stop turning economic and trade issues into political and security issues. As the foundation of the China-U.S. relationship lies in grassroots connections, the United States should work in the same direction with China and take more measures to facilitate the flow of people between the two countries. China will also urge the United States to fulfill its responsibilities as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and play a constructive role for the political settlement of major, salient international and regional issues, not the contrary.

The leading official emphasized that China's U.S. policy is consistent, which is underpinned by the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forward by China. These principles are the lessons learned from the 50-plus years of China-U.S. relations as well as the conflicts between major countries in history. China and the United States should put in a lot of efforts to follow them. China has all along believed that major-country competition is not the solution to the problems facing the United States or the world.

The leading official also took questions from the media. On Ukraine, the official said that China's position is aboveboard, and it will continue to promote peace talks, work for political settlement and carry out mediation diplomacy. The United States should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and stop smearing, framing, pressuring and blackmailing China. China will continue to take strong and resolute measures to safeguard its major interests and legitimate rights.

On the South China Sea issue, the leading official emphasized that China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the region have sufficient historical and legal basis, and that countries in the region have full confidence, wisdom and capability to properly handle the issue. Countries outside the region should not do things that provoke confrontation or increase tensions.

The leading official pointed out that on the Middle East issue, China is committed to promoting peace and justice and supports all parties in safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, especially the restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine. The immediate priority is that all parties to the conflict must earnestly implement the relevant Security Council resolutions and create conditions for an early comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza. The international community should pool their efforts to this end. It is hoped that the United States will heed the voices of the majority of the international community and adopt a responsible position.

Responding to the U.S.'s unwarranted accusation that China is a threat to the international order, the leading official said that China's development is an important part of human progress and an inevitable trend in the evolution of history. China does not follow the old path of Western colonization and plundering, nor the wrong path of seeking hegemony with growing strength. Nor does it seek to export its ideology. China is committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and is a firm defender of the U.N.-Centered international system and international order, which contributes to the force for peace and the stabilizing factors in today's world."

270724,Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu Attends the US-China Business Council Event Commemorating the 45th Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the United States,"On July 26, 2024, Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu attended and delivered a speech at the US-China Business Council event commemorating the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States upon invitation.

Ma Zhaoxu said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations 45 years ago, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs, but have always moved forward. On January 1 this year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, emphasizing the commitment to stabilizing and developing the bilateral relationship for the benefits of both countries and the world. The three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping are the fundamental guidelines for China in handling its relationship with the United States. China and the United States should respect each other's social systems and development paths, and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs, obstructing or containing each other's development, or undermining each other's core interests. Confrontation has no way out, the ""new Cold War"" has no winner, and cooperation is the only correct choice for the two countries. China is firmly determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, and no external force can stop China's development and growth.

Ma Zhaoxu pointed out that the Resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has drawn a grand blueprint for China to further deepen reform comprehensively, which will not only greatly advance Chinese modernization, but also create broader space for the development of enterprises from various countries, including the United States, in China. He hoped that the United States will work with China in the same direction, earnestly implement the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state at the San Francisco Summit meeting, establish a correct understanding, strengthen practical cooperation, deepen cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and promote the steady and long-term development of China-U.S. relations."
270724,Wang Yi Meets with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On July 27, 2024 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Vientiane at the latter's request. The two sides exchanged views on current China-U.S. relations, and agreed to maintain communication at all levels and further implement the important common understandings reached by their Presidents at the San Francisco meeting.

Wang Yi said that in the past three months, the diplomatic, financial, law enforcement, and climate teams of the two governments and the two militaries have maintained communication, and people-to-people exchanges have been on the rise. However it must be pointed out that the U.S. has not stopped, but rather doubled down on its containment and suppression of China. The risks facing China-U.S. relations are still building, and the challenges rising. The relationship remains at a critical juncture of deescalation and stabilization. We need to continue to recalibrate the direction, manage risks, properly address differences, remove interference, and advance cooperation.

Wang Yi said that China's U.S. policy is consistent, and adheres to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. The U.S. side should earnestly implement the commitments made by President Biden, and return to a rational and pragmatic China policy. The two sides need to work together for a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-U.S. relationship.

Wang Yi pointed out that the U.S. side holds a wrong perception of China, always seeing China with its own hegemonic mindset. China is not the United States, nor does China want to become like the United States. China does not pursue hegemony, or practice power politics. China has the best record on peace and security among all major countries. The third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee adopted a major resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. We will stay committed to our founding aspiration, and focus on seeking happiness for the Chinese people, and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. China will stay on the path of peaceful development, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. It is hoped that the U.S. side will better understand the CPC as well as China's present and future through this resolution.



Wang Yi said that Taiwan is part of China, and it never has been and never will be a country. “Taiwan independence” and cross-Strait peace are as irreconcilable as fire and water. Each time “Taiwan independence” forces make provocation, we will definitely take countermeasures. We will keep reducing the space for “Taiwan independence” and work toward the goal of complete reunification.

Wang Yi reiterated the ins and outs of the Ren'ai Jiao (Reef) issue. Now that China has agreed on a provisional arrangement with the Philippines on managing the situation, the Philippine side should honor its commitment, and not ship construction materials any more. The U.S. side should not take any more action to fan the flames, stir up trouble, or undermine maritime stability.

Wang Yi said that China's position on the Ukraine issue is fair and transparent, and China will continue to encourage and promote peace talks. The U.S. side should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction. China rejects false accusations, and will not succumb to pressure or blackmail. China will take resolute and robust measures to protect its major interests and legitimate rights.



Blinken said that the United States is strongly committed to stabilizing U.S.-China relations and continues to follow the one-China policy. The U.S. side looks forward to keeping in regular communication with the Chinese side and continuing the cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics and artificial intelligence. The U.S. would like to manage differences between the two sides and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.

The two sides also exchanged views on the situation concerning Gaza and the Korean Peninsula, and the question of Myanmar, among other matters."
220724,Wang Yi Holds a Group Meeting with Delegation of the U.S.-China Business Council Board of Directors,"On July 22, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a group meeting with the delegation of the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) Board of Directors in Beijing.

Wang Yi welcomed the representatives of the U.S. business community for their visit to China. Noting that the USCBC celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, Wang Yi said that President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter fully affirming the USCBC's work and encouraging the USCBC to build more bridges of friendly exchanges between China and the United States, forge more bonds of practical cooperation, and contribute to writing a new chapter of win-win cooperation between China and the United States in the next 50 years.

Wang Yi said, the just-concluded Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee is an important meeting that attracted worldwide attention with historic significance. He said, ""As the first delegation from the U.S. business community to visit China after the plenum, you can feel the new atmosphere of China's further deepening reform comprehensively from the first time, making your visit a highly timely one."" A review of China's development history shows that China has made great strides to catch up with the times thanks to its reform and opening up. After the 18th CPC National Congress, China has successfully achieved its first centenary goal, also as a result of reform and opening up. Now to usher in a new phase of Chinese modernization and achieve the second centenary goal, China still needs to rely on reform and opening up. The Resolution adopted by the plenum has more than 20,000 characters, covering all aspects of promoting Chinese modernization, and offers a panoramic view of further deepening reform comprehensively. The Resolution lays out more than 300 important reform tasks, and makes it clear that all of them shall be completed by the time the People's Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029, which will provide a solid guarantee for Chinese modernization.

Wang Yi further introduced the important measures in the Resolution on deepening reform, especially high-standard opening up, pointing out that China's reform and opening up is guided by principles and has a clear direction, and the overall objectives are to continue to improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize China's system and capacity for governance. Any attempt to change China's social system and development path is futile. China is following the right path chosen by the Chinese people, and will neither copy foreign models nor export the Chinese model. China is ready to strengthen exchanges and integration with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect and move forward hand in hand on the path to world modernization.



Wang Yi pointed out that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. Whether China and the United States engage in cooperation or confrontation bears on the well-being of their two peoples and the future of humanity. China has consistently maintained stability and continuity in its policy toward the United States. It has always handled its affairs with the United States in accordance with the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. China is committed to strengthening dialogue, managing differences and expanding cooperation with the United States, so as to stabilize, improve and push forward China-U.S. relations. At the same time, China also has interests, principles and a bottom line that it must safeguard. Wang Yi expressed the hope that the U.S. business community will continue to work hand in hand with China to not only achieve greater development for itself, but also make new contributions to the development of China- U.S. relations and the friendship between the two peoples.

Wang Yi listened carefully to the remarks of the U.S. representatives and responded to each of their concerns.

Wang Yi said, as President Xi Jinping pointed out that for China and the United States, two major countries, turning one's back on another is not an option; it is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other; and conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides. Viewed from the perspective of ""my own country first"", the world is a cramped and crowded place perpetuated in ""fierce competition"". Viewed from the perspective of ""a global community with a shared future"", the world is a vast and broad place full of cooperation opportunities. The earth is broad enough for China and the United States to develop and prosper together. The past 45 years have shown that when the overall environment of China-U.S. relations is favorable, all parties will benefit. In an unfavorable environment, the scope for exchanges and cooperation is inevitably constrained. Wang Yi expressed the hope that the USCBC and its member companies will make full use of their connections and influence, and drawing upon their development experience in China, present a true, multi-dimensional and panoramic view of China to the U.S. government, Congress and all walks of life. He urged them to voice more objective, positive and rational views to promote the right perception of China in the United States, stop suppressing China in economy, trade, science and technology, and effectively resolve the obstacles that hinder people-to-people and cultural exchanges to promote the steady and sound development of China-U.S. relations.

USCBC Board Chair Rajesh Subramaniam, Founder of United Family Healthcare Roberta Lipson, President of Boeing Global Brendan Nelson, CEO of the United States Education Testing Service Amit Sevak, and USCBC President Craig Allen said that they welcome the important signal of further deepening reform comprehensively released by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee. The consistency, coherence and stability of the Chinese government's policies are crucial for foreign companies, including those from the United States, to continue to invest and do business in China on a long-term basis. The representatives hope that the plenum will stimulate China's new round of economic reform and further opening up, and attract more sustainable foreign investment. The U.S.-China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world, of which economic and trade relationship is a stabilizing factor. The U.S. business community has confidence in continuing to deepen its cooperation with China and looks forward to further deepening bilateral cooperation in economy, trade, investment, green development, healthcare, education, people-to-people and cultural exchanges and other fields. It is committed to building a strong and balanced U.S.-China relationship, which fully serves the common interests of the two countries and two peoples. The USCBC is ready to actively leverage its influence and role and firmly act as a stabilizing force for the development of U.S.-China relations."

060624,Xi Jinping Replies to Letter from President of Kean University Lamont Repollet,"Recently, President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Lamont Repollet, president of Kean University of the United States, encouraging Chinese and American universities to strengthen exchanges and cooperation and contribute to China-U.S. friendship.

Recalling witnessing the signing ceremony of the China-U.S. cooperation agreement on jointly establishing Wenzhou-Kean University in 2006 at Kean University, Xi Jinping said he is pleased to see that with the joint efforts of both sides, Wenzhou-Kean University has achieved remarkable results and become a landmark project in China-U.S. educational cooperation.

Xi Jinping pointed out that China-U.S. relations bear on the well-being of the two peoples and the future of mankind. Educational exchanges and cooperation will help promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples, especially between the youth of the two countries. It is a project for future development of China-U.S. relations. Xi expressed appreciation for what Repollet said in his letter about deepening cooperation with Wenzhou-Kean University and encouraging American students to come to China for exchange and study, and called on universities of the two countries to step up exchanges and cooperation through different modalities to cultivate young envoys who know both countries well, and build more bridges to promote China-U.S. friendship.

In the reply letter, Xi Jinping welcomes Repollet and other members of the American education community to visit China more often, and asked Repollet to convey his regards to Dr. Dawood Farahi, former president of Kean University.

In May 2006, under the care and facilitation of the then Secretary of CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee Xi Jinping, Wenzhou University and Kean University of the United States formally signed an agreement, deciding to jointly establish Wenzhou-Kean University. In 2014, with the approval of the Ministry of Education, Wenzhou-Kean University was officially established. At present, it has about 4,500 students across undergraduate, master's, and doctoral programs, and over 3,300 have earned their undergraduate degrees over the past eight years. Recently, President Lamont Repollet of Kean University sent a letter to President Xi Jinping, expounding on the progress and achievements of the cooperative education, and voicing readiness to actively respond to President Xi's initiative, help more American teenagers to come to China for exchange and study, and promote exchanges between the young generation of China and the United States."
280524,China and the United States Hold the Second Round of Consultations on Maritime Affairs,"On May 24, 2024, the second round of consultations on maritime affairs between China and the United States was held via video link. Director-General of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Hong Liang and State Department China Coordinator and Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of East Asia and Pacific Affairs of the United States Mark Baxter Lambert co-chaired the consultations.

The two sides had an exchange of views on maritime situations and relevant maritime issues, and agreed to maintain dialogue and communication, avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment, and manage maritime risks. The Chinese side expressed grave concerns over the U.S. side's infringement and provocative moves in waters off China's coast, and urged the U.S. side to earnestly respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, refrain from meddling in maritime disputes between China and its neighbors, refrain from ganging up to ""use the sea to contain China"", and refrain from undermining peace and stability in the region.

The Chinese side emphasized that the one-China principle is the political foundation of China-U.S. relations and an important basis for maritime dialogue between the two sides. ""Taiwan independence"" is the biggest threat undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. side should immediately stop supporting and conniving with the forces for ""Taiwan independence"", and honor its commitment to not supporting ""Taiwan independence""."
220524,Xi Jinping Sends Letter to the Opening Ceremony of the 14th China-U.S. Tourism Leadership Summit,"On May 22, 2024, President Xi Jinping sent a letter to the opening ceremony of the 14th China-U.S. Tourism Leadership Summit.

Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, Xi Jinping said the foundation of China-U.S. relations is laid by the people, the door of China-U.S. relations is opened by the people, the stories of China-U.S. relations are written by the people, and the future of China-U.S. relations will be jointly created by the people of the two countries.

Xi Jinping stressed that tourism is an important bridge for exchanges and mutual understanding between the people of China and the United States.

260424,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On the afternoon of April 26, President Xi Jinping met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

President Xi Jinping noted that this year marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. Over the past 45 years, the relationship has gone through wind and rain, and the two sides can draw a few important lessons: China and the United States should be partners rather than rivals; help each other succeed rather than hurt each other; seek common ground and reserve differences rather than engage in vicious competition; and honor words with actions rather than say one thing but do another. He proposed mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as the three overarching principles for the relationship. They are both lessons learned from the past and a guide for the future.



President Xi Jinping emphasized that in his phone call with President Biden three weeks ago, he shared his thoughts on how to stabilize and develop China-U.S. relations in 2024, and underlined that the two sides should value peace, prioritize stability, and uphold credibility. “The finer details will fall into place when they are aligned with the bigger picture,” he once stressed. The world today is undergoing transformation not seen in a century. How to respond to it is a question of the times and of the world. President Xi’s answer is to build a community with a shared future for mankind, which has become a flag of China’s foreign policy and has been welcomed by many countries. Planet Earth is only this big, and humanity is faced with so many common challenges. As an old Chinese saying goes, “Passengers in the same boat should help each other.” Today, as he sees it, dwellers of the same planet should help each other. We live in an interdependent world and rise and fall together. With their interests deeply intertwined, all countries need to build maximum consensus for win-win and all-win outcomes. This is the basic starting point for China to view the world and the China-U.S. relationship. President Xi underlined his view that major countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and act with broad-mindedness and a sense of responsibility. China and the United States should set an example in this regard, undertake responsibilities for world peace, create opportunities for the development of all countries, provide the world with public goods, and play a positive role in promoting global unity.

President Xi Jinping underscored that in his meeting with President Biden in San Francisco, he proposed five pillars for China-U.S. relations, namely, jointly developing a right perception, jointly managing disagreements effectively, jointly advancing mutually beneficial cooperation, jointly shouldering responsibilities as major countries, and jointly promoting people-to-people exchanges. They should serve as the underpinning for the mansion of China-U.S relations. When the overarching principles are established, specific issues will become easier to address. China is willing to cooperate, but cooperation should be a two-way street. China is not afraid of competition, but competition should be about progressing together instead of playing a zero-sum game. China is committed to non-alliance, and the U.S. should not create small blocs. While each side can have its friends and partners, it should not target, oppose or harm the other. China welcomes a confident, open, prosperous and thriving United States, and hopes the United States will also look at China’s development in a positive light.

President Xi Jinping stressed that as a Chinese saying goes, “No progress means regress.” It also applies to China-U.S. relations. The stabilizing trend in China-U.S. relations did not come by easily. It is hoped that the two teams will continue working actively to follow through on the San Francisco vision he and President Biden reached, so as to truly stabilize, improve and move forward the bilateral relations.



Secretary Blinken conveyed President Biden’s greetings to President Xi. He noted that since President Biden and President Xi met in San Francisco, the U.S. and China have made good progress in their cooperation in such areas as bilateral interactions, counter-narcotics, artificial intelligence and people-to-people exchanges. The multiplicity and complexity of the challenges the world faces require the U.S. and China working together. The Americans from all walks of life that he met during the visit all expressed the hope to see U.S.-China relations improve. The U.S. does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China’s system, does not seek to suppress China’s development, does not seek to revitalize its alliances against China, and has no intention to have a conflict with China. The U.S. adheres to the one-China policy. It hopes to maintain communication with the Chinese side, follow through on what the two presidents agreed in San Francisco, seek more cooperation, avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations, responsibly manage differences, and achieve stable development of U.S.-China relations.

President Xi asked Secretary Blinken to convey his regards to President Biden.

180424,MFA Coordinator for Cyber Affairs Wang Lei Takes an Exclusive Interview with CCTV,"On 15 April 2024, Mr. Wang Lei, Coordinator for Cyber Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs took an exclusive interview with CCTV regarding the report newly released by China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) exposing the truth that the US hypes up the so-called “Volt Typhoon” and launches false allegations against China. The transcript is as follows:

CCTV: The CVERC has just released a report on the so-called “Volt Typhoon” hacker group this morning, exposing a huge scandal of collusive corruption and premeditated false allegations against China by cybersecurity agencies and relevant companies of the US, the largest hacker state. Do you have any comment on this?

Wang Lei: The CVERC has released a new report, uncovering a scandal of how to get budget from the US government by making unscrupulous and baseless accusations against China. The US side has been constantly hyping up the so-called “Volt Typhoon”, with some senior officials claiming that a “PRC-sponsored hacking group” launched cyber attacks against critical infrastructure in Guam and elsewhere in the US.

In response to this accusation, this newly released report has revealed a very important conclusion that the so-called “Volt Typhoon” is actually an international ransomware group. Through collusive corruption and launching false allegations against China, US cybersecurity agencies and relevant companies have gained enormous profits for themselves, and at the same time fueled the irrational elements in the US policy towards China.

Cybersecurity has always been an important and special topic in China-US relationship. The whole world is puzzled at why the US, as the largest hacker state, is constantly hyping up hacking threats from China. We may find an important clue to answer this question through this report.

More concerningly, the US side has for the first time indicated the connection between cybersecurity and the situation across the Taiwan Strait when cooking up the “Volt Typhoon”. China’s position is clear cut, that is we are strongly opposed to the US interference in China’s domestic affairs under the pretext of cybersecurity, and will stay on high alert against US true intentions behind their practice of fabricating a topic for discussion and then making use of it to serve their hidden agenda. Any attempt to gain advantage in future scenarios pertaining the Taiwan question shall be futile.

It is in the interest of all countries to protect critical infrastructure. And it is in the interest of all countries, including China and the US, to safeguard peace and stability in cyberspace. We hope that the US, as a major power, could take a more serious and responsible attitude. The US shall not overestimate its ability to unilaterally set the rules in cyberspace according to its own will, nor underestimate China’s resolve to maintain, on equal terms, bilateral relations pertaining cybersecurity."
150424,Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu Meets with U.S. Diplomatic Officers,"The Chinese side has set forth solemn positions on the U.S.'s recent move to push for the Indo-Pacific Strategy against China and its erroneous words and actions related to China taken in China's neighborhood, in particular its attempts to build a circle of the United States, Japan and the Philippines and its disturbance of the situation in the South China Sea. China urged the U.S. side not to engage in bloc confrontation and undermine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Chinese side made clear its position on Taiwan, trade, science and technology, people-to-people and cultural exchanges and other issues, urging the U.S. side to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop impeding China's development, stop imposing unreasonable sanctions on Chinese enterprises and stop suppressing China's trade, science and technology."
070424,Li Qiang Meets with U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen,"On the morning of April 7, 2024, Premier Li Qiang of the State Council met with U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Li Qiang said that under the strategic guidance of the two presidents, the current China-U.S. relationship is beginning to stabilize. Not long ago President Xi Jinping spoke with President Joe Biden on the phone, and both sides agreed to strengthen dialogue, manage differences and advance cooperation to promote the steady development of China-U.S. relations. The Chinese side hopes that China and the U.S. will be partners rather than adversaries, and will respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation. Li Qiang expressed the hope that the U.S. will further work with China in the same direction, continue to act on the common understandings between the two presidents, and turn the San Francisco vision into reality.

Li Qiang pointed out that as the world's two largest economies, China and the U.S. have deeply intertwined economic interests. Closer trade and economic cooperation is of great importance to each other's development and global economic growth. The two sides should strengthen communication to jointly find ways to manage and resolve differences, so as to make China-U.S. trade and economic cooperation stable, smooth and efficient, create more benefits for the enterprises and people of the two countries, and contribute to the world's economic development and improvement of people's livelihoods. Li Qiang expressed the hope that the U.S. will work with China to uphold the basic norms of market economy including fair competition and open cooperation, rather than politicize or impose security implications on economic and trade issues, and view issues of industrial capacity objectively and dialectically from a market-oriented and global perspective and in accordance with the economic laws. The development of China's new energy industry will contribute significantly to the green and low-carbon transition worldwide. China is ready to strengthen policy coordination with the U.S. on climate change and other issues to jointly address global challenges.

Janet Yellen said that with the joint efforts of both sides, the U.S.-China relationship has become more stable. As the world's two largest economies, the U.S. and China should manage bilateral economic relations responsibly. The U.S. side appreciates the progress made in U.S.-China economic dialogue and cooperation, does not seek ""decoupling"" from China, and stands ready to work with China to implement the important common understandings reached at the two presidents' meeting in San Francisco, communicate candidly, avoid misunderstandings, deepen exchanges and cooperation, properly manage differences, jointly cope with pressing global challenges, and promote the steady development of the U.S.-China relations."
020424,President Xi Jinping Speaks with U.S. President Joe Biden on the Phone,"On the evening of April 2, President Xi Jinping spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden on the phone at the request of the latter. The two presidents had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and issues of mutual interest.

President Xi Jinping noted that his San Francisco meeting with President Biden last November opened a future-oriented San Francisco vision. Over the past months, their officials have acted on the presidential understandings in earnest. The China-U.S. relationship is beginning to stabilize, and this is welcomed by both societies and the international community. On the other hand, the negative factors of the relationship have also been growing, and this requires attention from both sides.

President Xi Jinping stressed that the issue of strategic perception is always fundamental to the China-U.S. relationship, just like the first button of a shirt that must be put right. Two big countries like China and the United States should not cut off their ties or turn their back on each other, still less slide into conflict or confrontation. The two countries should respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation. The relationship should continue moving forward in a stable, sound and sustainable way, rather than going backward.

President Xi Jinping underlined three overarching principles that should guide China-U.S. relations in 2024. First, peace must be valued. The two sides should put a floor of no conflict and no confrontation under the relationship, and keep reinforcing the positive outlook of the relationship. Second, stability must be prioritized. The two sides should refrain from setting the relationship back, provoking incident or crossing the line, so as to maintain the overall stability of the relationship. Third, credibility must be upheld. The two sides should honor their commitments to each other with action, and turn the San Francisco vision into reality. They need to strengthen dialogue in a mutually respectful way, manage differences prudently, advance cooperation in the spirit of mutual benefit, and step up coordination on international affairs in a responsible way.

President Xi Jinping stressed that the Taiwan question is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations. In the face of “Taiwan independence” separatist activities and external encouragement and support for them, China is not going to sit on its hands. He urged the U.S. side to translate President Biden’s commitment of not supporting “Taiwan independence” into concrete actions. The U.S. side has adopted a string of measures to suppress China’s trade and technology development, and is adding more and more Chinese entities to its sanctions lists. This is not “de-risking,” but creating risks. If the U.S. side is willing to seek mutually beneficial cooperation and share in China’s development dividends, it will always find China’s door open; but if it is adamant on containing China’s hi-tech development and depriving China of its legitimate right to development, China is not going to sit back and watch.

President Xi Jinping stated China’s position on Hong Kong-related issues, human rights, the South China Sea, and other issues.

President Joe Biden noted that the U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world. The progress in the relationship since the San Francisco meeting demonstrates that the two sides can advance cooperation while responsibly managing differences. President Biden reiterated that the United States does not seek a new Cold War, its objective is not to change China’s system, its alliances are not targeted against China, the U.S. does not support “Taiwan independence,” and the U.S. does not seek conflict with China. The U.S. follows the one-China policy. It is in the interest of the world for China to succeed. The U.S. does not want to curtail China’s development, and does not seek “decoupling” from China. The U.S. will send Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to visit China shortly to strengthen dialogue and communication, avoid miscalculation and promote cooperation, so as to advance the relationship on a stable path and jointly respond to global challenges.

The two presidents also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and other issues.

The two presidents found the phone call to be candid and constructive. The two sides agreed to stay in communication, and tasked their teams to deliver on the San Francisco vision, including advancing the consultation mechanisms on diplomatic, economic, financial, commercial and other issues as well as mil-to-mil communication, carrying out dialogue and cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, artificial intelligence and climate response, taking further steps to expand people-to-people exchanges, and enhancing communication on international and regional issues. The Chinese side welcomed visits to China by Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the near future."
270324,"President Xi Jinping Meets Representatives of U.S. Business, Strategic and Academic Communities","On March 27, President Xi Jinping met with representatives of the U.S. business, strategic and academic communities at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.



President Xi Jinping welcomed members of the U.S. business, strategic and academic communities to China in blooming spring. He noted that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. Whether China and the United States have a cooperative or confrontational relationship bears on the well-being of the Chinese and American peoples and the future of humanity. The two countries’ respective success is an opportunity for each other. As long as both sides see each other as partners and show mutual respect, coexist in peace and cooperate for win-win results, China-U.S. relations will get better. This year marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. The history of China-U.S. relations is one of friendly exchanges between the two peoples. Its existing chapters are written by the people, and the future will of course be created by the people. As a Chinese saying goes, doing good is as hard as an uphill climb, while a misstep may easily lead to a free fall. President Xi Jinping expressed the hope that people from all sectors of Chinese and American societies will have more mutual visits and exchanges, expand common ground and mutual trust, overcome various distractions, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, in an effort to bring more tangible benefits to the two peoples and inject more stability into the world. 



President Xi Jinping listened attentively to his U.S. guests and responded to their comments.



President Xi Jinping pointed out that the Chinese economy is sound and sustainable. Last year, China registered one of the highest growth rates among the major economies and accounted for over 30 percent of global growth as before. This was due both to the hard work of the Chinese people and to international cooperation. China has come to where it is today after overcoming all kinds of difficulties and challenges. China did not collapse as predicted by the “China collapse theory,” nor will it peak as forecasted by the “China peak theory.” We will continue to advance high-quality development and Chinese modernization, enable the Chinese people to live a better life, and contribute more to sustainable development in the world. We have the confidence and determination that China’s development has a bright future. 



President Xi Jinping recalled his oft-repeated saying that reform and opening up holds the key to contemporary China’s catching up with the times in great strides. China’s reform will not pause, and its opening up will not stop. China is planning and implementing a series of major steps for comprehensively deepening reform, and steadily fostering a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment. This will create broader development space for U.S. and other foreign businesses. Faced with the recent years’ new and evolving situation in China-U.S. business ties, the two sides should stay committed to mutual respect, mutual benefit and equal-footed consultation, follow economic and market rules, expand and deepen mutually beneficial business cooperation, respect each other’s development rights, and work for win-win outcomes for the two countries and the world at large. U.S. businesses are welcome to participate more in Belt and Road cooperation, attend large-scale business events such as the China International Import Expo, and continue to invest in China, cultivate the market and grow their business.

President Xi Jinping emphasized that over the past couple of years, the China-U.S. relationship experienced some setbacks and serious challenges, from which lessons should be learned. The relationship cannot go back to the old days, but it can embrace a brighter future. The most important understanding he reached with President Biden at last year’s San Francisco meeting was on the need to stabilize and improve China-U.S. relations. In the past few months, Chinese and U.S. officials have worked to follow through on the common understandings of the two Presidents, maintained communication and made progress in the political and diplomatic, economic and financial, law enforcement and counternarcotics, climate change and people-to-people fields. Under the new circumstances, China and the United States have more, not fewer, common interests. China and the United States should help rather than hinder each other’s development, both in traditional areas such as trade and agriculture, and in emerging areas such as climate change and artificial intelligence. Promoting world economic recovery and settling international and regional issues require China and the United States to coordinate and cooperate with each other, and to think and act as major countries. The U.S. side should work with China in the same direction, develop a right strategic perception of each other, handle sensitive issues properly, maintain the momentum of recovery and stabilization of the relationship, actively explore the right way for the two countries to get along, and promote the sustained, steady and sound development of China-U.S. relations.



In their remarks, Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and CEO of Blackstone Stephen A. Schwarzman, President and CEO of Qualcomm Cristiano R. Amon, Founding Dean of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government Graham Allison, and President of the U.S.-China Business Council Craig Allen thanked President Xi Jinping for taking time to meet them. They noted that China’s exceptional economic growth and transformation over the past decades speak to its strong resilience and vitality. Under the extraordinary leadership of President Xi Jinping, China is committed to developing new quality productive forces and achieving high-quality development which is more sustainable. The development rights of the Chinese people should be respected. They expressed confidence that China will realize its development goals and contribute to a stronger, more integrated global economy. A strong and prosperous China is a positive force in the world. Sharing close economic ties, the United States and China can only develop and thrive in peaceful coexistence. The Thucydides trap is not inevitable. U.S. businesses applaud the important measures that China has recently rolled out to further reform and open up, are optimistic about China’s development prospects, will maintain their strong commitment to the Chinese market, and pursue close and long-term cooperation with China. The San Francisco meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden last November has shored up the expectation and confidence of all sectors of American society and the world in U.S.-China relations. The U.S. business, strategic and academic communities support the United States and China in bolstering exchanges and communication at all levels, enhancing mutual understanding, trust and cooperation, joining hands to address global challenges, and fostering a stable, sustainable and productive U.S.-China relationship.



Wang Yi participated in the meeting."
260324,Wang Yi Meets with Responsible Officials of National Committee on U.S.-China Relations,"On March 26, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Chairman of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR) Evan G. Greenberg and President of the NCUSCR Stephen A. Orlins in Beijing.

Wang Yi said, in November last year, the NCUSCR together with other friendly organizations, overcame difficulties and obstacles and, in response to the common aspirations of the two peoples, held a grand welcome banquet for President Xi Jinping in San Francisco. In his speech, President Xi Jinping reviewed the history of friendly exchanges between the two peoples and stressed that the hope and foundation of China-U.S. relations lies with the people, the future lies with the youth and the vitality lies with sub-national entities. Wang Yi expressed the hope that the NCUSCR will continue to play a constructive role in strengthening exchanges between the two peoples and promoting the sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations.



Wang Yi stressed that the crux of China-U.S. relations is that the United States has positioned China as its most important strategic competitor and most important geopolitical challenge. Such misunderstanding has led to constant problems in bilateral relations, and promises made by U.S. leaders have failed to translate into concrete actions. Such a situation runs counter to the interests of the two peoples, the expectations of the international community and the trend of historical development. The United States should work with China to provide more support and facilitation for exchanges between the two peoples, enhance mutual understanding through face-to-face contacts, and stabilize, improve and advance bilateral relations.

The U.S. side said President Xi Jinping's visit to San Francisco was highly successful, setting a new tone and direction for bilateral relations between the two countries. President Xi Jinping engaged in candid communication with various sectors of the United States and announced the invitation of 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study over the next five years, which was warmly welcomed. The relationship between the United States and China is the most significant bilateral relationship in the world. Maintaining communication and contact to ensure that the relationship between the two countries progresses in a constructive direction is beneficial for the entire world. U.S.-China relations begin with contact, which does not mean compromise, but is the only way for the sound and correct development of bilateral relations. The NCUSCR will continue to play a positive role in promoting exchanges and contacts between the two countries."
260324,Wang Yi Meets with Professor Graham Allison from Harvard University,"On March 26, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with Professor Graham Allison from Harvard University in Beijing.

Wang Yi said the most important event in international relations for the past 50 years is the recovery and development of China-U.S. relations. In the next 50 years, what the international community expects most is that China and the United States find a proper way to get along with each other. On the basis of a profound review of the development of China-U.S. relations, President Xi Jinping has put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, which are consistent with traditional Chinese culture and China's diplomatic philosophy, and provide fundamental guidance for China to view and handle China-U.S. relations.

Wang Yi said, China and the United States are countries with completely different histories and cultures, and cannot judge each other by their own standards. Chinese philosophy suggests harmony without uniformity, and holds that different roads may run in parallel without interfering with one another, and all living things may grow side by side without harming one another. This is essentially different from the binary opposition thinking of some Americans, which is characterized by a black-and-white and I-win-you-lose approach. The Chinese side believes that China and the United States should jointly address the global challenges and establish a more stable, sound and sustainable relationship. Bearing the future of humankind in mind, President Xi Jinping has also proposed the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind. This is not only a lofty goal pursued by Chinese diplomacy but also provides a Chinese solution to the questions of ""what kind of world to build and how to build it"". Wang Yi expressed the hope that the academia will strengthen research on the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other and the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and propose constructive ideas beyond the traditional theory of international relations.



Graham Allison said Chinese leaders have given deep thought to the world today and to U.S.-China relations. President Xi Jinping's proposal of the three principles for developing China-U.S. relations is highly significant and enlightening. China's explanation of mutual respect as the precondition, peaceful coexistence as the baseline, and win-win cooperation as the goal is helpful for the academia to better understand China's foreign policy. In today's complex world, binary opposition cannot solve the problems. China and the United States must cooperate and find a correct way to get along with each other, which is crucial to both countries and the world. Graham Allison expressed the willingness to gain a deep understanding of China's profound history and culture, and to better understand China's foreign policy, in particular the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind."
260324,Cai Qi Meets with Chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group of the United States Stephen A. Schwarzman,"On March 25, 2024, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Cai Qi met with Chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group of the United States (U.S.) Stephen A. Schwarzman in Beijing.

Cai Qi said that China-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral relations in today's world. To implement the common understandings reached between the two heads of state and realize the San Francisco vision is the most important task for the two sides, which requires active participation and support of people from all walks of life in the two countries. China is now advancing the building of a strong nation and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. He expressed the hope that Mr. Schwarzman will continue to cultivate success in China, share opportunities together, promote educational cooperation and people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries, increase the trust and friendship between the two peoples, especially those between the youth of the two countries, tell a good story of China-U.S. friendship and cooperation, consolidate the public support of bilateral relations, and inject more positive energy into China-U.S. relations.

Stephen A. Schwarzman said that, with the joint efforts of both sides, the Schwarzman program launched eleven years ago has made positive progress. He expressed the willingness to strengthen cooperation with China to increase exchanges and mutual learning between China and the world so that more people can understand China's development prospects, and contribute to the stable development of U.S.-China relations and the building of a better world."

020324,Han Zheng Attends and Addresses the AmCham China Annual Appreciation Dinner,"On March 1, 2024, at the invitation of the American Chamber of Commerce in the People's Republic of China (AmCham China), Vice President Han Zheng attended and addressed the AmCham China Annual Appreciation Dinner in Beijing.

Han Zheng said, as this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters. The ""San Francisco vision"" reached at the meeting between the two heads of state last year has charted the course for the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations and drawn a blueprint. Over the past half century, China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has achieved tangible results and made important contributions to the economic and social development of both countries. The business communities of the two countries are participants, witnesses and contributors to the bilateral cooperation, and will also be pioneers of more and better cooperation in the future. Han Zheng expressed the hope that the business circles of China and the United States will consolidate the foundation of friendship and mutual trust, actively expand cooperation areas, create a favorable environment for development, and promote China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation for mutual benefit as well as steady and sustained progress.

Han Zheng said that China's economy has strong resilience, great potential and vast space, and new drivers and advantages are still developing and growing. As China's development achievements have been made in the opening up, China will unswervingly expand opening up at a high level, continue to reduce the negative list for foreign investment access, effectively guarantee the national treatment for foreign-funded enterprises, and foster a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment to provide more opportunities for companies of all countries, including American companies, for their development in China. Noting that the China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has huge potential, broad space and promising prospects, Han Zheng welcomed more friends from the U.S. business community to invest and do business in China. He expressed the expectation that AmCham China can keep in mind its original intention and forge ahead, strengthen communication and contacts with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and other organizations, and jointly push for more results in China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation.

Nearly 500 representatives from the business communities of China and the United States attended the event. Before the start of the event, Han Zheng had a group meeting with the main foreign representatives and took a group photo."

The two sides had candid, in-depth and constructive communication on respective foreign policies, international situation and regional hotspot issues."
280224,Li Qiang Meets with U.S. Chamber of Commerce Delegation,"On the morning of February 28, 2024, Premier Li Qiang of the State Council met with a U.S. Chamber of Commerce delegation led by President and Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Suzanne P. Clark at the Great Hall of the People.

Li Qiang said that since the summit meeting between the heads of state of China and the United States in San Francisco last November, the two sides have carried out a series of dialogues and communication to promote pragmatic cooperation between the two countries. This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters, emphasizing the continuous commitment to stabilizing and developing China-U.S. relations for the benefit of both countries and the world. The practice over the past 45 years has proved repeatedly that China and the United States both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, and cooperation is the only correct choice. Based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, China is ready to work with the United States to follow through on the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations.

Li Qiang noted that the Chinese and U.S. economies are highly complementary, and their interests are deeply integrated. Both sides benefit from each other's development, and strengthening economic and trade cooperation is beneficial to both countries. The two sides should be partners rather than rivals. Engaging in ""decoupling and severing supply chains"" or ""a small yard, high fences"" in all forms is not in the fundamental interests of both sides and will only bring huge losses to enterprises in the two countries, to the economy, and even to global development. China is now advancing Chinese modernization on all fronts through high-quality development, and will continue to unleash huge demand in advanced manufacturing, new urbanization, the upgrading of the consumption structure, green and low-carbon transformations, and other aspects. U.S. companies are welcome to continue investing in China and exploring the Chinese market to share the development opportunities. China will open its door even wider to the outside world, continue to foster a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized, and provide more support and convenience for U.S. companies and firms from other countries to invest and do business in China. He expressed the hope that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its entrepreneurs will continue to serve as a bridge in promoting more communication and mutual understanding between the two countries.

Clark said that the U.S.-China relationship is extremely important. She was pleased that the two heads of state held a successful summit meeting in San Francisco, and that the relationship between the two countries showed momentum of improvement. Decoupling between the United States and China is not a viable option, and China's further opening-up is welcome. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is willing to act as a bridge, conduct candid and constructive communication and exchanges with the Chinese side, make efforts to deepen U.S.-China economic and trade relations and mutually beneficial cooperation, and promote the steady development of U.S.-China relations.

Wu Zhenglong was present at the meeting."
240224,Xi Jinping Replies to Letter from Students of the U.S. Muscatine High School Delegation to China,"On February 24, 2024, the Chinese Lantern Festival of the Year of the Dragon, President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from students of the U.S. Muscatine High School delegation to China, and sent them Chinese New Year cards. He extended holiday wishes to them and all the teachers and students of the school, and encouraged more young Americans to come to China for exchange and study.

Noting the students' beautiful handwriting of Chinese characters and their vivid hand drawings of the Chinese dragon, Great Wall and panda in the letter, Xi Jinping said he was very pleased to know that the students visited several cities in China, where they saw the giant pandas, tasted Chinese food, experienced Chinese culture, and felt “super happy”. Learning that they have made friends with many Chinese peers and invited them to pay a return visit to their hometown, Xi said he found their friendship very heart touching.

Quoting a Chinese proverb, Xi Jinping said ""seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times"". He recalled his first visit to the United States in 1985, and noted that he was deeply impressed by the warmth and friendliness of the American people during the trip. Xi expressed the belief that through this visit, the students would have a more direct and deeper understanding of China and the Chinese people. He said the students are welcome to visit China again, and encouraged more young Americans to visit China for exchange and study, so as to have a glimpse of the real China in a multi-dimensional and comprehensive manner, and make heart-to-heart friendship with young Chinese and learn from each other, thus making joint contributions to enhancing the friendship between the people of the two countries.

Xi Jinping said in his letter that today is the Lantern Festival of the Chinese Year of the Dragon and it is an important occasion for the Chinese people to wish for a better life. Xi extended his best holiday wishes to the students and all the teachers and students of their school.

During his visit to the United States in November 2023, President Xi Jinping announced a program to invite 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study in the next five years. Sarah Lande, a friend of Xi in the U.S. state of Iowa, wrote a letter recently to President Xi, in which she expressed the hope that Muscatine High School can join the program. Thanks to President Xi's support, more than 20 students of Muscatine High School visited Beijing, Hebei and Shanghai from January 24 to 30, becoming the first group of American middle school students to visit China under the program. When they arrived in Beijing, they brought with them gifts to President Xi, including a school flag with Chinese characters ""Grandpa Xi, Here We Are"". After the visit, the students of the delegation wrote a letter to President Xi, sharing their joy and happiness during the visit and thanking him for inviting them to China."
230224,Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Korean Peninsula Affairs Liu Xiaoming Holds Virtual Meeting with U.S. Senior Official for the DPRK Jung H. Pak,"On February 22, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Korean Peninsula Affairs Liu Xiaoming had a video call with U.S. Senior Official for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Jung H. Pak. They exchanged views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

Liu Xiaoming elaborated on China's principles and position on the Korean Peninsula issue. He said that it is in the common interest of the region and the international community to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and push forward the process of political settlement of the Peninsula issue. The parties concerned should face up to the crux of the Peninsula issue and address each other's concerns in a balanced manner through meaningful dialogue. China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Peninsula issue.

Jung H. Pak said that the U.S. values China's role in addressing the Peninsula issue and hopes to communicate and cooperate with China in this regard.

The two sides agreed to maintain contact on the Peninsula issue."
170224,Wang Yi Meets with U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken,"On February 16, 2024 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken at the latter's request on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. The two sides had a candid, substantive and constructive meeting.

Wang Yi said, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a successful meeting at the end of last year, where they had an in-depth exchange of views on strategic and overarching issues critical to the direction of China-U.S. relations and reached important common understandings. The most important task for the two sides now is to follow the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, make the ""San Francisco vision"" a reality, and move forward China-U.S. relations along the track of sound, steady and sustainable development. To this end, the two sides should adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and actively explore the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other. The U.S. side should take an objective and rational view of China's development, pursue a positive and pragmatic China policy, and honor President Biden's commitments with concrete actions.

Wang Yi stressed that there is but one China in the world, and Taiwan is part of China's territory. This is the true status quo of the Taiwan question. It is the ""Taiwan independence"" separatist activities and the connivance and support of external forces that are trying to change this status quo. If the U.S. side genuinely hopes to see stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, and follow through on its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"".

Wang Yi emphasized that the attempts to ""de-China"" in the name of ""de-risking"" and to build ""a small yard with high fences"" to ""decouple from China"" will ultimately backfire on the U.S. itself. Wang Yi called on the U.S. side to lift its illegal unilateral sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals and refrain from doing things harmful to China's legitimate development rights and interests.



The two sides had an exchange of views on carrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges and facilitating personnel exchanges. Wang Yi urged the U.S. side to stop the unwarranted harassment and interrogation of Chinese citizens and do more things conducive to enhancing mutual understanding between the two peoples. As an old Chinese saying goes, ""An act of kindness, no matter how trivial, is worth doing, while an act of evil, no matter how small, must be shunned.""

The two sides discussed exchanges at all levels between the two countries in the next stage, and agreed to maintain dialogue and communication in various fields and further deliver on the ""San Francisco vision"". Both sides spoke highly of the work of the China-U.S. counter-narcotics cooperation working group, and expressed the expectation that the coming high-level meeting between the law enforcement departments of the two countries will achieve positive results. Both sides agreed to continue to promote dialogue and consultation on foreign policy, Asia-Pacific affairs, maritime affairs and artificial intelligence, and maintain military-to-military communication.

The two sides also had an exchange of views on the Ukraine crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Korean Peninsula and other regional hotspot issues, and agreed to keep contact between the two sides' special envoys for Peninsula affairs."
110224,Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan Reply to Chinese New Year Greeting Card from Teachers and Students of U.S. Lincoln High School,"On February 11, 2024, President Xi Jinping and Madame Peng Liyuan replied to a Chinese New Year greeting card from teachers and students from Lincoln High School of the U.S, extending to them their best wishes for the Year of the Dragon, and welcoming them to visit China more often, including participating in the exchange and study programs which plan to invite 50,000 young Americans to China over five years, so as to contribute their part to enhancing the friendship between the two peoples, especially between the young people.

Earlier, teachers and students of Lincoln High School in the U.S. State of Washington sent a New Year card to President Xi Jinping, Professor Peng Liyuan, and all Chinese people, extending festive greetings to the Chinese people, and wishing the Chinese people happiness and health in the new year. More than 100 teachers and students signed the greeting card."
270124,Wang Yi Holds Meetings with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan,"From January 26 to 27, 2024 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi held a new round of meetings with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Bangkok. The two sides had candid, substantive and productive strategic communication on implementing the common understandings reached between the two heads of state at the summit meeting in San Francisco and properly handling important and sensitive issues in China-U.S. relations.

Wang Yi said that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. The two sides should take this opportunity to sum up experience and draw lessons, treat each other as equals instead of in a condescending way, build common ground and shelving instead of highlighting differences, and respect instead of undermining each other's core interests. Both sides should work together toward mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, finding the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other.

Wang Yi stressed that the Taiwan question is China's internal affair, and the election in the Taiwan region cannot change the basic fact that Taiwan is part of China. ""Taiwan independence"" poses the biggest risk to cross-Strait peace and stability and the biggest challenge to China-U.S. relations. The U.S. side must abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, translate its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"" into action and support China's peaceful reunification.

Wang Yi pointed out that every country has its national security concerns, but these concerns must be legitimate and reasonable. There should be no politicizing or overstretching of the concept of security, nor can these concerns be used to suppress and contain other countries' development. The two sides agreed to further discuss the boundary between national security and economic activities.

The two sides agreed to jointly implement the ""San Francisco vision"": the two heads of state will maintain regular contact to provide strategic guidance to bilateral relations; promote exchanges in various fields and at various levels between China and the United States, make good use of current strategic communication channels as well as a series of dialogue and consultation mechanisms in such areas as diplomacy, military, economy, finance, business and climate change; continue discussions on the guiding principles of China-U.S. relations; launch a working group on counternarcotics cooperation between China and the United States in the near future; hold the first meeting of China-U.S. inter-governmental dialogue mechanism on artificial intelligence this spring; and take further steps to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.

The two sides also discussed international and regional issues, including the Middle East, Ukraine, the Korean Peninsula and the South China Sea."
100124,Xi Jinping Replies to Letter from His Friend Sarah Lande in the U.S. State of Iowa,"On January 4, 2024, President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from his friend Sarah Lande in the U.S. State of Iowa.

Xi Jinping pointed out that since the establishment of China-U.S. diplomatic relations 45 years ago, bilateral relations have gone through the tests of winds and rains, and grown into a towering tree, bearing the fruits of cooperation and delivering benefits to both countries and the rest of the world. Achievements in China-U.S. relations are first attributable to the collective efforts of the two peoples. For China-U.S. relations to advance, it hinges more on the two peoples.

Xi Jinping emphasized that the future of China-U.S. relations depends on the youth. Citing the Chinese saying ""Read 10,000 books and travel 10,000 miles,"" Xi Jinping expressed his hope that more young Americans will visit China, observe China with their own eyes, listen to China with their own ears and measure China with their own footsteps to have a glimpse of a real China in a multi-dimensional and comprehensive manner and build more bridges of the close affinity between the two peoples when he announced that China will invite 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study in the next five years. Xi Jinping said, he welcomes the students of Muscatine to participate in this project.

Xi Jinping emphasized that China is the largest developing country and the United States is the largest developed country in the world, the future of this planet needs stability and improvement of China-U.S. relations. China is ready to work with the United States to push for steady, sound and sustainable development of bilateral relations to bring more benefits to the two peoples, provide more public goods for the international community, and build a clean and beautiful world, featuring lasting peace, security for all, common prosperity, openness, and inclusiveness.

In a recent letter to President Xi Jinping, Sarah Lande, a friend in the U.S. State of Iowa, said, President Xi Jinping's speech at a welcome dinner held by the friendly organizations in the United States was widely welcomed and inspiring.

050124,Wang Yi Puts Forward Three Proposals on Implementing the Important Common Understandings Reached Between the Two Heads of State of China and the United States,"On January 5, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi put forward three proposals on implementing the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state when attending the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.

First, uphold mutual respect, with having a right perception of each other as the current priority. Are China and the United States partners or adversaries? This is an overarching question determining where this relationship will be heading. The Chinese people believe that “all ways of life should thrive without hindering each other; all living things should flourish without harming each other.” China’s development and rejuvenation is driven by its robust internal dynamics and is a historical inevitability. To advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization means that China will take on more responsibility and make greater contribution to world peace and development. We have no intention to displace or lord over anyone, still less to seek hegemony. What we are committed to is building a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship on the basis of mutual respect. We hope that the U.S. side will go easy on itself, and in the spirit of equality and inclusiveness, respect the choice of the Chinese people, respect the development path of China, respect China’s core interests, and respect China’s efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Second, ensure peaceful coexistence, with with effective management of disagreements as the top priority. China and the United States differ in social system and development path due to their different histories and cultural traditions. Disagreements should not lead to confrontation, still less willful sanctions, power politics, hegemonism or zero-sum game. What is needed is a vision and unwavering commitment to seeking common ground while shelving differences, and allowing no disagreements or differences to dominate or disrupt the bilateral relationship. 45 years ago, China and the United States were able to rise above disagreements and establish diplomatic relations. Today, we must assume such vision and sense of responsibility. President Xi Jinping once pointed out that disagreements should not be a chasm to keep the two countries apart, and that instead, the two sides should look for ways to build bridges to help them walk toward each other. That is the right approach for China and the United States to handle disagreements.

Third, pursue win-win cooperation, with mutually beneficial collaboration as the ballast. Over the past few years, thanks to the joint efforts from both sides, military-to-military communications and dialogue have recently resumed on the basis of equality and respect, and the working group on counternarcotics cooperation will soon be launched after the removal of the obstacle of unilateral sanctions. Going forward, the two sides must continue to make the most of the mechanisms resumed or established in diplomatic, economic, financial, commercial and agricultural areas. They should build bridges of communication as soon as possible, and pave the way for cooperation. They should remove barriers to exchanges, break false information cocoons, forge closer links between the two peoples, and generate more positive energy for the sound growth of China-U.S. relations."
050124,Wang Yi Talks about Inspirations Drawn from the Growth of China-U.S. Relations,"On January 5, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of China-U.S. diplomatic relations in Beijing. Wang Yi elaborated on three inspirations drawn from the 45-year growth of China-U.S. relations.

First, peace is the most fundamental bedrock of the China-U.S. relations. As the largest developing country and the largest developed country of the world, China and the United States together account for one-fourth of the global population and more than one-third of the world’s economic aggregate. No conflict or confrontation between the two major countries is in itself the most important peace dividend for mankind. The absence of conflict and confrontation between the two major countries is in itself the most important peace dividend for humanity. Meanwhile, as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the two countries shoulder primary responsibility for world peace and security.

Second, cooperation is THE right choice for China and the United States to get along with each other. Over the past few decades, the whole world has witnessed for decade show powerful China-U.S. cooperation has been -- in counter-terrorism,addressing global financial crises, fighting Ebola, and seeking political solutions to hotspot issues. Under the current circumstances, their common interests are growing not declining, and the necessity for cooperation increasing not decreasing. It can be said that for the two countries and the world, China-U.S. cooperation is not something dispensable or optional.It is a compulsory question that must be addressed in real earnest.

Third, win-win cooperation is the most essential feature of China-U.S. interaction. The nearly U.S.$760 billion bilateral trade and over U.S.$260 billion two-way investment between China and the United States tells a lot about their complementarity in economic structure, connectivity in global industrial and supply chains, and shared interest in common development.. It is an inevitable outcome of international division of labor in the globalized world, a rational decision by the two business communities, and a natural option out of complementarity. Mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States is like a mighty river flowing into the ocean. Any decoupling attempt to stem the tide will only be counterproductive and self-defeating."
050124,Wang Yi Attends the Commemoration of the 45th Anniversary of China-U.S. Diplomatic Relations,"On January 5, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.

Wang Yi said in his address that January 1 this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America. President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden have exchanged congratulatory letters. President Xi Jinping pointed out in his letter that over the past 45 years, China-U.S. relations have kept moving forward on the whole in spite of ups and downs, and that this has not only improved the well-being of the two peoples, but also contributed to peace, stability and prosperity of the world. Both presidents highlighted their continued commitment to stabilizing and developing China-U.S. relations to the benefit of the two countries and the world as a whole.

Wang Yi pointed out that 45 years ago, with outstanding strategic vision and extraordinary political courage, the elder generation of Chinese and the U.S. leaders, established the one-China principle, thus opening long-shut doors and starting all-round exchanges between the two long-estranged major countries. Through the past 45 years, China-U.S. relations have overcome various difficulties and disruptions, and kept advancing, with the breadth of their cooperation, the depth of their entwined interests, and the magnitude of impact and influence of their relationship reaching unprecedented levels. Plants with strong roots grow well, and efforts in the right way ensure success. Making its way through twists and turns for nearly half a century, the China-U.S. relationship is like a surging river -- much is washed away but the most valuable stays, namely, useful inspirations regarding the fundamentals of their relationship.



First, peace is the most fundamental bedrock of China-U.S. relations. The absence of conflict and confrontation between the two major countries is in itself the most important peace dividend for humanity. Second, cooperation is the right choice for China and the United States to get along with each other.

The nearly 760 billion U.S. dollars of bilateral trade and over 260 billion U.S. dollars of two-way investment between China and the United States tell a lot about their complementarity in economic structure, connectivity in global industrial and supply chains, and the shared interest in common development. Any decoupling attempt to stem the tide will only be counterproductive and self-defeating.

Wang Yi emphasized that today, transformation not seen in a century is unfolding across the world. China-U.S. relationship is the most important and intricate bilateral relationship in the world. How to re-calibrate the direction of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations, steer it clear of hidden rocks and shoals, and guide it through gorges of historical significance is a major subject that we must think about thoroughly and a question we must answer for our times. Last November, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a historic meeting in San Francisco, and created the future-oriented San Francisco vision, charting the course for and adding impetus to the bilateral relationship. The two sides should take San Francisco as a new starting point, make the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation the right way to get along with each other, and truly deliver on the important common understandings reached by the two presidents.

The two sides should uphold mutual respect, with having a right perception of each other as the current priority. Are China and the United States partners or adversaries? This is an overarching question determining where this relationship will be heading. To advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization means that China will take on more responsibility and make greater contribution to world peace and development. China has no intention to displace or lord over anyone, still less to seek hegemony.

Wang Yi hopes that in the new year both Chinese and Americans with vision and insight from all sectors will come forward with their energy and dynamism and work together to push forward the China-U.S. relationship in the right direction.

Chargé d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in China David Meale also addressed the reception. He extended on behalf of the U.S. side congratulations on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, saying that the U.S. side is willing to implement the common understandings reached between the two heads of state and promote the steady development of U.S.-China relations.

In his letter, Xi Jinping pointed out that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States is a major event in the history of bilateral and international relations. Over the past 45 years, despite the ups and downs, the China-U.S. relationship has on the whole moved forward, which has not only enhanced the well-being of the two peoples, but also promoted world peace, stability and prosperity. History has fully proven and will continue to prove that upholding mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation is the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other as two major countries, and should become the common direction of efforts of both China and the United States in the new era.

Xi Jinping noted that he and President Biden, during their summit meeting in San Francisco, laid out a future-oriented ""San Francisco vision"", charting the course for the development of China-U.S. relations.
