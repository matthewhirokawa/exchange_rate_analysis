These sanctions do not advance U.S.-led efforts to achieve a ceasefire, bring all hostages home, and end the war.

270525,"Department Press Briefing – May 27, 2025","QUESTION: King Charles has been in – speaking to the Canadian parliament in the last few hours, saying that Canada faces another critical moment, and is determined to protect democracy, self-determination, freedom. “The true north is indeed strong and free.” And that’s being seen by many as a clear endorsement of Canada’s sovereignty, a rejection of the idea of it being the 51st state. Do you endorse his sentiments?

MS BRUCE: I’m a fan of Prince Charles – King Charles and of Prince William and Princess Kate. I think they’re a great family. That’s it.

QUESTION: And on their – on Canada’s sovereignty?

MS BRUCE: Yes, Shaun. Go ahead. (Laughter.)

QUESTION: If we could come back to Gaza as – specifically because tomorrow the – Germany’s foreign minister is going to be here and meeting with the Secretary. As Germany’s government has kind of shifted quite a lot in the last few days on their position of support for Israel, they’ve been, alongside the U.S., one of the main backers of Israel in this war. And now they’re saying – the chancellor is saying that the war in Gaza is no longer justified by the need to fight Hamas. So, it seems like that whatever coalition was left of countries, including U.S., backing Israel seems to be getting smaller. Are you concerned that there’s even less international support for Israel? Does that influence the way that the U.S. is thinking about this, that one of the main European countries backing Israel is – has been backing down?

MS BRUCE: Well, again, Chancellor Merz noting that Israel’s actions can no longer be justified. The fact of the matter is, is that Hamas has put the people in Gaza in this situation by launching that attack on October 7th and by continuing to hold hostages, including the bodies of four Americans, and continue, of course, to maintain their weapons. So, when we think about actions that can no longer be justified, I think we should adjust ourselves and look at what put us in this position in the first place.

Regarding the UK, Canada, France, and any number of others that took disappointing steps last week – unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, in this case – is unproductive and obstructs ongoing U.S. efforts towards peace in the region. And I think that there is a clear line that has been drawn by President Trump, which, again, definitely disturbs the status quo, which is that there has to be peace – not just for six months, not because there’s been a deal made for a year, that this has to be enduring. The entire framework has to change.

He’s not kidding. He’s not kidding because otherwise, in five years or sooner, someone will be in your position, someone else will definitely be in my position, having the same conversation. We can’t allow that to continue. That is President Trump’s understanding and vision of the change that needs to occur. And the fact is, is that the status quo does seem to be perhaps the easier thing to maintain, but it’s not the one that’s going to save lives.

All right, yes. There. Right there. Go ahead. Speak up. Yeah.",USA

QUESTION:  Absolutely.  I’ll repeat it.  Have you taken any steps to carry out President Trump’s plans, as he has said he would like to annex Canada?  Have you taken any steps in that direction?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, I think what the – no, no, what the President has said, and he has said this repeatedly, is he was told by the previous prime minister that Canada could not survive without unfair trade with the United States, at which point he asked, well, if you can’t survive as a nation without treating us unfairly in trade, then you should become a state.  That’s what he said. 

They’ll have their elections this week.  They’re going to have a new leader and we’ll deal with the new leadership of Canada.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I think the President has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state.  I mean, and he has said that based on what he was told by the previous prime minister, who said Canada can’t survive unless it treats the U.S. unfairly in trade.

150425,G7 Foreign Ministers’ Statement Marking Two Years Since the Beginning of the Devastating War in Sudan,"We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, unequivocally denounce the ongoing conflict, atrocities and grave human rights violations and abuses in Sudan, as the world marks two years since the beginning of the devastating war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

As a direct result of the actions of the SAF and the RSF, the people of Sudan, especially women and children, are enduring the world’s largest humanitarian and displacement crises, and continued atrocities, including widespread conflict-related sexual violence, ethnically motivated attacks and reprisal killings. These must end immediately.

We strongly condemn the RSF attacks carried out in and around El Fasher on the Zamzam and Abu Shouk IDP camps, which have caused numerous casualties, including humanitarian workers. Civilians must be protected and allowed safe passage.

As famine continues to spread across Sudan, G7 members are disturbed by reports of the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and reiterate that such actions are prohibited under international humanitarian law.

We call on the warring parties to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law and their commitments under the Jeddah Declaration, which include the crucial responsibility to distinguish at all times between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military targets.

We call on all parties to the conflict to lift impediments to effective crossline humanitarian assistance, provide assurances of safety and security for local and international humanitarian actors, and allow humanitarian access through all border crossings into Sudan, including through South Sudan and Chad. We recognize the important role of Emergency Response Rooms in providing for and protecting civilians and call for their protection. We further call on all parties to refrain from attacks on critical infrastructure that civilians rely upon, including dams and telecommunications systems.

We call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and urge both the SAF and the RSF to engage meaningfully in serious, constructive negotiations. All external actors must cease any support that further fuels the conflict, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles adopted at the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and Neighbouring Countries in Paris in 2024 and the United Nations arms embargo on Darfur. We condemn all violations and unlawful attacks by the SAF, the RSF, and their allied militias.

For sustainable peace in Sudan, any resolution to the conflict must be rooted in the voices of Sudanese civilians. Women, youth, and civil society must be meaningfully included in all peace processes.

We reaffirm our support for a democratic transition and express our solidarity with the people of Sudan in their efforts to shape the future of their country that reflects their aspirations for freedom, peace and justice.

The sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Sudan are paramount.

G7 members remain committed to deepening collective diplomatic efforts to bring about an end to the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and secure an end to the conflict, including through the London Sudan Conference.",USA

But in this case, they’re ignoring the criminal behavior of these people to try to turn it into a speech issue. I know that you’ve been on fire on that issue in the interviews that I’ve seen. I do want to ask you – only have a minute left together with you, Secretary Rubio – you just came back from Canada. You were up there for those G7 meetings. How was your reception in Canada given the strains between our countries right now – the 51st-state trolling, all of that? How did that go for you as a representative of the United States and the Trump Administration?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, it went fine. I mean, first of all, it was a G7 gathering, so it wasn’t about the Canada issue. It just happen to be hosted by Canada, sort of a remote location or what have you. And certainly, it came up, and I think sometimes – I mean, it’s dominating their news, and at the end of the day it is what it is, but ultimately, I mean, we had a lot of other issues to talk about of great importance. I mean, we’re aware of it – I mean, it dominates Canadian news, it’s like the only thing they talk about is this thing. But at the end of the day, when it comes to the trade piece of it, this is ultimately – it’s not about Canada; it’s not about Mexico; it’s not about the European Union. It’s about everybody. The President rightfully states that the state of global trade is completely unfair to America – completely unfair. So, I get why all these countries are unhappy, because they got a great deal going on and they want to keep it going.

The President says no, we’re going to reset the baseline, the baseline of trade, so that it’s fair. Everyone – what do you charge us, we’re going to charge you. And then we can negotiate – countries that want to can negotiate with us on a one-on-one bilateral basis to see if we can come up with trade deals with them that are fair to both sides. But we have to negotiate from a new status quo. We can’t negotiate from an old – the existing status quo, which is completely – why would any of these countries negotiate with us new trade deals if the one they have now is unfair and benefits them? Why would they give that up?",USA
140325,"Secretary of State Marco Rubio Remarks to the Press at Fairmont le Manoir Richelieu, Charlevoix, Canada","SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I mean, I just have a couple points and then I’ll answer your questions. Then I’m sure you’re dying to get home.

So first, I want to thank Canada. They did a great job of hosting us, and Foreign Minister Joly, who had to leave here. She’s going to go be sworn in, remain at her post, and she’s become a friend in the last few weeks as we’ve worked together. I knew her a little bit before but have gotten to know her now, obviously, in this role. They did a great job of hosting. It’s a beautiful place. And so, we’re grateful to them.

QUESTION: So, this is about Canada and your meeting with Foreign Minister Joly: Do you understand why the Canadians are taking such umbrage at these comments coming from the President? Is that something that you —

SECRETARY RUBIO: She’s – the Canadian Government has made their position, how they feel about it clear. The President has made his argument as to why he thinks Canada would be better off joining the United States from a – for economic purposes. There’s a disagreement between the President’s position and the position of the Canadian Government. I don’t think that’s a mystery coming in, and it wasn’t a topic of conversation, because that’s not what this summit was about.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, the Alien Enemies —

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary? Mr. Secretary, you said that the tariff policy was not hostile. However, President Trump yesterday in his social media post said that the EU previously had been hostile and abusive towards the United States. How do you square that? And secondly, is he serious when he’s talking about the 51st state being Canada?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I’m – I’ve already answered the question about Canada.

QUESTION: No, but is he serious?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah.

QUESTION: Do you take him seriously?

SECRETARY RUBIO: We’re not discussing that here today because that’s not what the purpose of this meeting is about. As far as the question that you’re asking me about hostility, yeah, the – look at the EU. Okay. The EU has a GDP basically comparable to that of the United States. Their composition of their economy is similar to ours. These are not developing countries; these are developed countries. And yet they have a significant trade surplus with the United States even though our economies are pretty much the same. These are not low-wage countries. That’s a problem. All the President is saying is we need to equalize treatment. Whatever they do to us, we need to do to them, in addition to pointing to certain sectors that we have to protect. Who can argue against the idea that if some country charges us X to export our products, we should charge them the same?

I get it. If you’re a country or the EU that’s benefiting from the status quo, you feel it is hostile to change the status quo because it’s to your benefit. The problem is the President of the United States is looking out for the United States – both the national security and in economic relations. We will reset the basis of our trade relationship, and then we can enter into negotiations for something that’s enduring and fair to both sides. That’s what the President seeks to do and that’s what – it begins by resetting, in a reciprocal way, the amount of tariffs we charge one another in our trade relations.

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, I take – I take your —

QUESTION: Mr. Secretary, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?

QUESTION: If I can follow up. Mr. Secretary, I know that we’re not speaking about Canada becoming the 51st state at this meeting, but I’m asking you now: Do you consider what the President has said about Canada becoming the 51st state – is he serious?

SECRETARY RUBIO: I’ll tell you how that came about. Okay. He’s in a meeting with Trudeau, and Trudeau basically says that if the U.S. imposes tariffs on Canada, Canada couldn’t survive as a nation-state, at which point the President said, well, then you should become a state. And that’s where this began. That said, the President has made an argument for why – he says he loves Canada. He says – he made an argument for why Canada would be better off joining the United States from an economic perspective and the like. He’s made that argument repeatedly, and I think it stands for itself.",USA

Ryan James Wedding, a Canadian citizen residing in Mexico, is a former Olympic snowboarder who participated in the giant slalom snowboarding event for Canada in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.  After his snowboarding career, Wedding turned to a life of crime as a transnational narcotics trafficker.

Wedding headed a complex transnational organized crime organization which coordinated the procurement and transportation of cocaine from South America to Canada.  After a concentrated investigation in both the United States and Canada, Wedding was charged with a co-conspirator in the Central District of California with running a continuing criminal enterprise, murder, and conspiring to possess, distribute, and export cocaine.  

Wedding was later charged in a superseding indictment, unsealed on October 16, 2024, with allegedly conspiring with others to ship bulk quantities of cocaine—weighing hundreds of kilograms—from Southern California to Canada through a Canada-based drug transportation network.  In this indictment, Wedding and the same co-conspirator were charged with directing the November 20, 2023, drug-related murders of two members of a family in Ontario, Canada, as well as ordering the murder of another victim in Canada on May 18, 2024, over a drug debt.

The U.S. Department of State is offering a REWARD OF UP TO $10 MILLION for information leading to Wedding’s arrest and/or conviction.  Wedding is also on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List.

060325,Up to $10 Million Reward Offer for Information Leading to Arrest and/or Conviction of Canadian Narcotics Trafficker,"Today, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs is announcing a reward offer under the Narcotics Rewards Program (NRP) of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction, in any country, of Canadian narcotics trafficker Ryan James Wedding.  This reward is offered in coordination with the governments of Canada and Mexico in a unified effort to bring Wedding to justice.

The FBI also announced the addition of Wedding to the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List.

Wedding is a former Olympic snowboarder who participated in the giant slalom snowboarding event for Canada in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.  After his snowboarding career, Wedding turned to a life of crime as a transnational narcotics trafficker.  He is last known to be residing in Mexico.

Wedding and another Canadian citizen residing in Mexico were charged in an original indictment with running a continuing criminal enterprise, murder, and conspiring to possess, distribute, and export cocaine.  Wedding’s co-conspirator was arrested on October 8, 2024, by Mexican law enforcement and was transferred on February 27, 2025, to the United States.

The first superseding indictment, unsealed on October 16, 2024, names 14 additional co-defendants.  The superseding indictment alleges that from January 2024 to August 2024, Wedding and others conspired to ship bulk quantities of cocaine – weighing hundreds of kilograms – from Southern California to Canada through a Canada-based drug transportation network run by co-conspirators in Ontario, Canada.  The cocaine shipments were transported from Mexico to the Los Angeles area, where the cocaine trafficking organization’s operatives would store the cocaine in stash houses before delivering it to transportation network couriers for transportation to Canada using long-haul semi-trucks.

As further alleged in the indictments, Wedding’s organization committed violence and murder to achieve its aims.  This includes the November 2023 murder of two members of a family in Ontario, Canada, in retaliation for a stolen drug shipment that passed through Southern California, as well as the May 2024 murder of another victim in Niagara Falls, Ontario, over a drug debt.  Of the 16 indicted subjects, only Wedding and one other co-conspirator remain fugitives.

Today’s reward offer is authorized by the Secretary under the NRP, which supports law enforcement efforts to disrupt transnational crime globally and bring fugitives to justice.  If you have information, please contact the FBI and RCMP by phone (WhatsApp, Signal, or Telegram) at 424-495-0614.  If you are located outside of the United States, you may also contact the nearest U.S., Canadian, or Mexican Embassy or Consulate.  If you are in the United States, you can also contact the local FBI field office.

150225,G7 Foreign Ministers’ Statement on the Margins of the Munich Security Conference,"The text of the following statement was released by the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union.

Begin text:

The G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, met on the margins of the Munich Security Conference for the first time under Canada’s 2025 Presidency.

The G7 members discussed Russia’s devastating war in Ukraine.  They underscored their commitment to work together to help to achieve a durable peace and a strong and prosperous Ukraine, and reaffirmed the need to develop robust security guarantees to ensure the war will not begin again.

The G7 members welcomed their discussion today with Andrii Sybiha, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. They recalled the G7’s important contribution towards ending the war in Ukraine, including through measures pursuant to the G7 Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine, by supporting Ukraine financially through the use of extraordinary revenues stemming from Russian Sovereign Assets, by imposing further cost on Russia, if they do not negotiate in good faith, through caps on oil and gas prices, and by making sanctions against Russia more effective. Any new, additional sanctions after February should be linked to whether the Russian Federation enters into real, good-faith efforts to bring an enduring end to the war against Ukraine that provides Ukraine with long-term security and stability as a sovereign, independent country.  The G7 members reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its freedom, sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.

The G7 members discussed the provision to Russia of dual-use assistance by China and of military assistance by DPRK and Iran.  They condemned all such support.

The G7 members discussed political, security and humanitarian issues in the Middle East, including in Israel, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iran, and their commitment to advancing regional peace and stability.  They underscored the importance of a durable, Israeli-Palestinian peace.  They reaffirmed their support for the full implementation of the ceasefire reached between Israel and Hamas, including for the release of all hostages and the expansion of humanitarian aid in Gaza.  The G7 members stand behind the ongoing efforts of Egypt, Qatar and the United States in continuing to work towards a permanent ceasefire.  They reiterated their unequivocal condemnation of Hamas and the need to ensure that Hamas neither reconstitutes militarily nor participates in governance.  They recognized Israel’s inherent right to self-defence, consistent with international law.

The G7 members welcomed the outcomes of the International Conference on Syria, hosted by France on February 13, 2025.  They reiterated their shared commitment to the people of Syria and their support for an inclusive political transition process, in the spirit of UN Security Council Resolution 2254.  They welcomed, as well, positive developments in Lebanon, including the recent election of President Joseph Aoun, the designation of Nawaf Salam as Prime Minister, and the formation of a new government.  The G7 members reaffirmed their commitment to both countries’ stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

The G7 members unequivocally condemned Iran’s destabilizing actions, including its rapid advancement of uranium enrichment without credible civil justification, its facilitation of terrorism organizations and armed groups across the Middle East and Red Sea, its proliferation of ballistic missiles and drones, and its transnational repression and violation of fundamental human rights.

The G7 members reiterated their commitment to a free, open and secure Indo-Pacific region, grounded in respect for the rule of law and sovereignty.  They strongly opposed any attempts to change unilaterally the status quo using force and underscored the importance of resolving disputes peacefully.  They strongly opposed China’s attempts to restrict freedom of navigation through militarization and coercive activities in the South China Sea.

The G7 members expressed serious concern over the DPRK’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs and reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They demanded that the DPRK abandon all its nuclear weapons, existing nuclear programs, and any other weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner in accordance with all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). They underscored that direct DPRK support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine marks a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security. They urged the DPRK to cease immediately all assistance for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, including by withdrawing its troops. They called upon DPRK to resolve the abductions issue immediately.

The G7 members also discussed urgent situations of conflict and instability elsewhere in the world, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan, and in Haiti and Venezuela.

The G7 Foreign Ministers looked forward to their meeting in Canada in Charlevoix, Quebec on March 12-14.

Done at London, Moscow, and Washington on January 27, 1967 Canada: Communication
Date of Action: February 11, 2025
The Secretary of State, in performance of the depositary duties of the United States of America, communicates the following:
In reference to United States Depositary Notification No. 2024-018 dated April 15, 2024, concerning the ratification by the Republic of Colombia of the aforementioned Treaty, by diplomatic note dated February 11, 2025, the Embassy of Canada in Washington communicated the following:
[Original language English]
“CANADA’S OBJECTION TO COLOMBIA’S DECLARATION UNDER THE TREATY ON PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE ACTIVITIES OF STATES IN THE EXPLORATION AND USE OF OUTER SPACE, INCLUDING THE MOON AND OTHER CELESTIAL BODIES
“With regard to the interpretative declaration made by the Republic of Colombia upon ratification:
“The Government of Canada has carefully examined the interpretative declaration made by the Republic of Colombia upon ratification of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (the “Treaty”), which declared that:
‘The Colombian State reaffirms, pursuant to Articles 101 and 102 of the Constitution, that the segment of the geostationary orbit corresponding to Colombia is part of Colombia and states its understanding that no portion of this Treaty contradicts the rights claimed by the Colombian State, and that the Treaty shall, likewise, not be interpreted in violation of these rights.’
“A declaration or statement that purports to exclude or modify the legal effect of the provisions of the Treaty in their application to the State making it constitutes a reservation within the meaning of Article 2(1)(d) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Government of Canada considers that the above-mentioned declaration made by the Republic of Colombia, which consists of a territorial claim over a portion of outer space, purports to exclude or modify the legal effect of Article II of the Treaty and therefore constitutes, in reality, a reservation to Article II of the Treaty.
“The Government of Canada notes that the reservation made by the Republic of Colombia relates to an essential provision of the Treaty, aims to exclude the obligation under that provision, and is incompatible with the object and purpose of the Treaty. The reservation made by the Republic of Colombia is, thus,
inadmissible under article 19(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Government of Canada therefore objects to the aforesaid reservation made by the Republic of Colombia and declares that it does not consider itself bound by the declaration made by the Republic of Colombia.
“This objection does not preclude the entry into force in its entirety of the Treaty between Canada and the Republic of Colombia.”",USA

300125,Secretary Marco Rubio with Megyn Kelly of The Megyn Kelly Show,"QUESTION:  We talked about Colombia.  That’s part of President Trump’s effort to shore up our borders and get rid of the illegal aliens who came under Joe Biden.  Part of that’s going to include, yes, Canada – he’s said that as well – but also obviously Mexico.  And President Trump is threatening to slap tariffs on both of them if they don’t get in line and start doing some of the things that we want them to do as soon as this Saturday.  They’re jumping up and down saying we want to cooperate, let’s work diplomatically before you slap tariffs on us.  Where do you stand on that?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’ve had conversations with Mexican Government officials.  I met yesterday with the foreign minister of Canada.  I think there are two topics, and they have to be separated, but they’re interrelated – the first is the migration, particularly with Mexico.  There are parts of Mexico – many parts of Mexico – in which the government doesn’t control those areas.  They’re controlled by drug cartels.  They are the most powerful force on the ground, and they are plowing into the United States.  They’re facilitating illegal migration, but they are also bringing in fentanyl and deadly drugs to our country.  That’s in our – that’s a national security threat and that needs to stop.  So we expect their cooperation on that, because they should.  If it was the other way around, they would expect that as well.  And that needs to be addressed.  

Similar – secondarily to that is the President feels that we have a trade imbalance and unfairness with Mexico on a number of products, including agricultural products, that are dumped on our markets, but also the Chinese.  What the Chinese are now doing is they’re creating these front companies.  They’re investing in Mexican manufacturing and then backdooring – using the USMCA, the free trade agreement, to get Chinese goods into America.  And so it creates this trade imbalance, and that needs to be confronted.  So when the President talks about tariffs, he talks about it on two fronts – as obviously a leverage and pressure point when it comes to cooperation on migration, but separate from that, it’s also related to unfairness in our trade relationship.   

What – with the Canadians obviously, the border is one of the biggest – if not the biggest border – land border in the world.  We share a common interest there.  I think they don’t want to see their country filled with fentanyl either.  I think they – if I were them, I’d be concerned that with the crackdown on illegal immigration in the United States, people would flee north into Canada.  So you would think we’d be able to work with them very cooperatively on border security.  And then there’s a broader trade imbalance with them that the President wants to address as well.  And – so that’s why those conversations are important.  These are not hostile moves.  They’re just —    

QUESTION:  Are these tariffs going to kick in on Saturday?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’ll see.  I mean, that’s the President’s decision to make.  And we’ll be prepared to address it from a foreign policy perspective.  Whatever decision he makes on those things, that’s his decision to make.  Whether he makes it this weekend or a week from now or a month from now, he clearly wants to address both illegal migration but ultimately also our economic interests.   

QUESTION:  Who is more likely to be the 51st state?  Canada or Greenland?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, again – (laughter) – look, I think that we’re a long ways from that point.  I think the President’s made his view on this very clear, and that is our interests in Greenland are in danger and that needs to be addressed, and he’s willing to buy it.  And our interests with Canada particularly – I think if you go back – and I think he said this publicly – he had a conversation with Trudeau, and he asked Trudeau, well, what would happen if I imposed these tariffs on you?  And he said, well, we would be done as a country.  We would be finished.  And his whole point is, well, if the only way you can survive as a country is by having a trade imbalance with the United States, then maybe you should just become a state.  

QUESTION:  Right.  

SECRETARY RUBIO:  And that was the genesis of that conversation.  So we have issues we need to address with Canada.  They’re good friends.  I mean, we work with them on a lot of things.  We have a deep partnership with them, and – but there are some issues we’re going to need to address. 

QUESTION:  But what – but what are the risks to us?  Because we’ve got the premier of Ontario saying we can’t bring knife to a gunfight here.  If they’re going to do this to us with these tariffs, we’ve got to fight back the same way.  We supply them with a bunch of electricity; let’s shut it down.  So can Canada shut our lights off?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, then who would they be selling it to?  Where else would they send that electricity?  I mean, it would hurt them as well.  They would have no market to sell it to.  And I would also argue that the United States – and that – look, that’s a – I don’t think Canada is a strategic threat to the United States.  I’m not comparing them to China or what have you, but it brings to mind the point of energy independence and how critical that is.  We don’t want to be in a situation – you mentioned that about Canada.  Imagine if in the future the argument is not Canada’s threatening that; well, who’s threatening that is China, who’s threatening that is Russia.   

I mean, one of the great mistakes that were made is by unilaterally disarming when it comes to energy production, by not fully utilizing our energy resources in this country – other countries didn’t follow the same line.  They – for example, China today has the largest capacity of unused – they are able to process more oil than any country in the world right now.  They’ve – and they build more coal plants than anybody in the world right now.  They’ll talk about green energy and batteries and cars, but they are using all-of-the-above strategy on their energy.  We’ve unilaterally disarmed on energy.  They’ve – all they’ve done is continue to increase their capabilities on energy, because they know you need energy to fuel all this.  AI alone was going to require an extraordinary amount of energy that the world right now can’t produce to fuel it.  Whatever country has energy resources that are cost-effective is going to dominate AI, which is going to dominate many, many fields. 

So I think, at the end of the day, it’s a reminder, when you talk about Canada, of why energy is a national security matter and why the U.S. must be able to have a reliable and consistent source of energy, or we are in a lot of trouble.  Our planes won’t fly, our ships won’t be able to sail, and our economy will not function without energy",USA

200125,Marine Biodiversity,"The Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs cooperates with other federal agencies to participate in a number of efforts to conserve marine biodiversity.  OPA also works closely with U.S. government agencies and indigenous subsistence communities to develop and coordinate U.S. policy relates to the international conservation of marine mammals, notably whales and polar bears.  U.S. policy on marine mammals is guided by the Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act.  Many of the world’s marine mammals cross international jurisdictions, therefore bilateral and multilateral arrangements have been developed to manage these populations.  OPA also works on marine protected areas, such as efforts to implement cooperation related to the world’s largest MPA in Antarctica’s Ross Sea.

International Whaling Commission

The United States is an active member of the International Whaling Commission  (IWC).  Established in 1946 under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, the Commission is responsible for “the proper conservation of whale stocks and orderly development of the whaling industry.”  In 1986, the Commission established a moratorium on commercial whaling, which sets all commercial harvest quotas at zero. Despite this moratorium, some countries still engage in commercial whaling activities. Norway and Iceland both conduct commercial whaling activities under an objection and a reservation to the moratorium, respectively. In December 2018, Japan announced that it was withdrawing from the IWC and would resume commercial whaling in its waters starting in July 2019.

Importantly for the United States, the IWC authorizes whaling for subsistence purposes.  Aboriginal subsistence whaling  is conducted by the indigenous communities from Denmark (Greenland), the Russian Federation, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the United States. Subject to domestic legal requirements, the United States works with the indigenous communities in Alaska and Washington State to ensure that IWC established quotas meet their cultural and subsistence needs.

The Commission is comprised of 88 member governments and meets biennially to review the status of whale stocks and adopt conservation measures, as appropriate.

The Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs participates in the formulation of U.S. goals, objectives, and strategies in the IWC and leads efforts within the IWC on behalf of the United States; the Secretary of Commerce has the responsibility of discharging the domestic obligations of the United States under the IWC.

Polar Bears

Iconic symbols of the Arctic, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is found in the five Arctic States (Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the United States). The worldwide population is estimated to be about 26,000, 60% of which are found in Canada. This total population is distributed among 19 sub-populations, two of which occur in the United States: the Southern Beaufort Sea stock, shared with Canada and the Bering/Chukchi Sea stock, shared with Russia.

Polar bears are dependent on sea ice for hunting, breeding, and in some cases denning.  Due to loss of sea ice habitat because of global climate change, the United States listed the polar bear as ‘threatened’ under the Endangered Species Act in 2008, providing significant protections to the polar bear.  Polar bears are hunted for subsistence purposes in the United States, Canada, Greenland, and Russia (however, the Russian Federal Government has not yet authorized the subsistence harvest).

There United States engages internationally on polar bears primarily through two international agreements. The 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears  ( “Range States Agreement) calls for cooperation and consultation among the countries on research involving conservation and management of polar bear populations. The Agreement also allows for subsistence hunting by indigenous populations.

The bilateral Agreement on the Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear Population  entered into force on September 23, 2007. The Agreement establishes a commission comprised of representatives of the United States and Russian Government as well as the indigenous populations dependent on polar bears.  The Commission meets annually and establishes a sustainable harvest level for the Alaska-Chukotka polar bear population, which is evenly divided between the United States and Russia.",USA

Overview:  The United States and Canada enjoy longstanding coordination on defense and security, including counterterrorism cooperation.  Canada’s National Terrorism Threat Level remained at “medium” through 2023, meaning authorities assessed a violent act of terrorism could occur.  The threat level has been “medium” since 2014.

2023 Terrorist Incidents:  On April 1, Abdul Aziz Kawam allegedly committed two assaults with a knife in Surrey, British Columbia, seriously injuring one person.  Kawam faces charges including attempted murder, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, and assault with a deadly weapon.  He allegedly carried out the assaults for the Islamic State.

On June 28, Geovanny Villalba-Aleman allegedly entered a gender studies class at the University of Waterloo and stabbed the professor and two students.  Villalba-Aleman faces charges of attempted murder, four counts of assault with a weapon, three counts of aggravated assault, two counts of possessing a weapon, and one count of mischief for damaging a Pride flag.  Prosecutors announced on September 8 that Villalba-Aleman would be prosecuted on terrorism charges, alleging that his actions were motivated by hate related to gender expression and identity.

Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  Canada’s strict privacy policies continued to complicate CT-related intelligence sharing within Canada, and between Canada and other countries.

During 2023 the following new and ongoing legal proceedings with a terrorism nexus also occurred:

On July 5, Patrick Gordon Macdonald was charged with terrorist activity for allegedly helping produce propaganda material for Atomwaffen Division.  This case was the first in Canada in which an individual advocating a violent far-right ideology had been charged with both terrorism and hate propaganda.
On July 28, Khalilullah Yousuf was charged with terrorism-related offenses for allegedly participating in a network that uses online and encrypted messaging platforms to support the Islamic State.
On October 5, Ammara Amjad, who was repatriated from northeast Syria in April, was charged with participating in activity of a terrorist group for leaving Canada in 2015 to join ISIS.
On November 16, Nathaniel Veltman, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack that killed four members of a Muslim family and seriously injured another in London, Ontario, in 2021, was found guilty of four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.
On November 28, Oguzhan Sert, perpetrator of a 2020 attack in Toronto motivated by “incel” (involuntary celibate) ideology was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for 10 years for first-degree murder and attempted murder.  Sert was 17 at the time the offenses were committed but was sentenced as an adult.  This was the first-time terrorism charges were pressed in Canada for an act motivated by incel ideology.
On December 1, Zakarya Rida Hussein pleaded guilty to a terrorism charge for sharing recruitment videos for the Islamic State on TikTok, writing bomb making instructions, and posting on Snapchat that his mission would begin during Pride month.
On December 8, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested two individuals for allegedly participating in the creation of Terrorgram Collective manifestos and Atomwaffen Division recruiting videos.
On December 15 a young person was charged for allegedly instructing someone to carry out a terrorist activity against Jews.  The perpetrator was under 17 at the time the offenses were committed and thus could not be named, under Canada’s Youth Criminal Justice Act.
From June through the end of the year, the RCMP arrested four “young persons” on terrorism peace bonds or terrorism-related charges.
Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  Canada is a member of the Financial Action Task Force and the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering.  Its Financial Intelligence Unit, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center (FINTRAC), is a member of the Egmont Group.

In 2023, Canada announced five rounds of sanctions on Iranian targets affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  In September, Canada published new regulations bringing the armored car and mortgage lending sectors under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and required financial entities to conduct enhanced due diligence on foreign entities with which they have banking relationships.  Following Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, FINTRAC joined the Counterterrorist Financing Taskforce-Israel, which aims to strengthen efforts to disrupt the international money flows to Hamas and support global antiterrorism efforts through the coordination of financial intelligence and information sharing.  In November, Canada passed legislation to create a public registry of beneficial ownership for federally registered companies.  Canada also passed other legislative changes, enabling law enforcement to freeze and seize virtual assets as well as introducing a new offense for structuring financial transactions to avoid mandatory reporting.

Countering Violent Extremism:  Public Safety Canada’s Canada Centre for Community Engagement and Prevention of Violence continued its close collaboration with its U.S. counterpart, DHS’s Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, and engaged with Five Eyes Countering Violent Extremism working groups such as the Research and Development and Digital Industry Engagement Senior Officials Group.  On May 3, Canada announced $25 million ($18.2 million USD) in funding to support new projects to address radicalization to violence through the Community Resilience Fund.

Following charges brought against a young person for terrorist activity in December, the RCMP noted a concerning trend of religiously motivated violent extremism and terrorist use of the internet.

In April, Canadian media reported on a 2022 intelligence assessment by the Integrated Terrorism Assessment Center finding the federal government’s efforts to further restrict the purchase and ownership of firearms could push domestic “extremists” to launch a terrorist attack.  The report stated that “any future extremist attack in Canada utilizing firearms is more likely to be committed by an extremist inspired by IMVE (ideologically motivated violent extremism) ideology, rather than RMVE (religiously motivated violent extremism).”

International and Regional Cooperation:  Canada resigned its position on the board of the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund in 2023 and is no longer represented on the board.  Canada is active in CT efforts of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, NATO, and the ASEAN Regional Forum.",USA

NOTE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Pursuant to Public Law 89—497, approved July 8, 1966
(80 Stat. 271; 1 U.S.C. 113)—
“. . .the Treaties and Other International Acts Series issued
under the authority of the Secretary of State shall be competent
evidence . . . of the treaties, international agreements other than

international agreements other than treaties, as the case may be,
therein contained, in all the courts of law and equity and of maritime
jurisdiction, and in all the tribunals and public offices of the
United States, and of the several States, without any further proof
or authentication thereof.”

DEPARTMENT OF STATE
WASHINGTON
November 22, 2024
Madam:
I have received your diplomatic note, dated November 15, 2024, and
have the honor to refer to the on-going negotiations between our
Governments in relation to the modernization of the Treaty between the
United States of America and Canada relating to the Cooperative
Development of the Water Resources of the Columbia River Basin
(“Treaty”). On July 8, 2024, our Governments reached an agreement in
principle regarding the modernization of the Treaty. The agreement in
principle refers to a milestone in the Treaty modernization negotiations.
The summary document produced in the context of those negotiations
reflects the mutual understandings of our Governments on core issues and
is the basis on which we are drafting text to amend the Treaty with a view to
developing a “Modernized Treaty”. Amendments to the Treaty would be
- 2 -
subject to domestic processes, on which our Governments are working as a
matter of priority to complete, for approval and entry into force.
Under the proposed Modernized Treaty, Canada would provide
defined pre-planned flood risk management (FRM) operations and the
United States of America would compensate Canada for those operations.
The Treaty does not require pre-planned FRM operations after
September 16, 2024, and the United States has not provided compensation
for pre-planned FRM operations that Canada would provide after that date.
The Modernized Treaty did not enter into force prior to that date.
In the interest of providing pre-planned FRM operations following
September 16, 2024, and before the entry into force of a Modernized Treaty
(“interim period”), the Entities designated under Article XIV of the Treaty
have entered into an agreement under Article XIV(2)(k) of the Treaty that
reflects the pre-planned FRM operations and compensation agreed in
principle during negotiations. This Columbia River Treaty Entity Agreement
- 3 -
Regarding Pre-Planned Flood Risk Management Arrangements During the
Interim FRM Period (“Interim Period FRM Entity Agreement”) stipulates that
during the Interim FRM Period the Canadian Entity would provide pre-
planned FRM operations for up to three consecutive operating years for
which the U.S. Entity elects for the provision of those operations by
compensating the Canadian Entity. The Interim FRM Period is defined to run
until the earliest of the first July 31 following the entry into force of the
Modernized Treaty, or July 31, 2027.
The executed Interim FRM Period Entity Agreement was enclosed with
your note and, per its terms, becomes effective upon an exchange of notes
between our Governments pursuant to Article XIV(4) of the Treaty.
The Government of the United States of America observes that the
Interim FRM Period Entity Agreement includes provisions for subsequent
agreements between the Entities, including detailed operating plans under
Article XIV(2)(k), and assured plans of operation, that would incorporate the
pre-planned FRM operations agreed in principle during the negotiations.
- 4 -
The Interim FRM Period Agreement also provides for the development of,
and updates to, a Flood Risk Operating Plan (“FROP”) by the U.S. Entity that
would be applicable to the operation of Canadian Treaty storage upon their
acceptance by the Canadian Entity.
The Government of the United States of America recognizes that the
scope of the Treaty, which remains in force, includes “cooperative measures
for hydroelectric power and flood control” and so encompasses the Interim
FRM Period Entity Agreement. The Government of the United States of
America understands that the Entities are taking the actions set out in this
note and Interim FRM Period Entity Agreement as prudent steps to enable
continued coordinated operation of pre-planned flood risk management at
Arrow Lakes Reservoir during the interim period.
The Government of the United States of America shares the
understanding expressed by the Government of Canada in its note that the
provision of and compensation for pre-planned FRM operations under the
Interim FRM Period Entity Agreement would be distinct from and in no way
- 5 -
related to the provision of and compensation for called-upon FRM
operations under Article IV(3) of the Treaty.
This reply, together with your note, constitutes the exchange of notes
contemplated by Article XIV(4) for the purposes of empowering and
charging the Entities to enter into the Interim FRM Period Entity Agreement,
including the development of the FROP by the U.S. Entity (including updates)
and their acceptance by the Canadian Entity.
The Government of the United States of America emphasizes its
understanding that the empowerment and charge provided through this
exchange of notes does not waive any options that may be available to
either Party to resolve any difference arising under the Treaty, as provided
in its Article XVI, and is without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the
Parties under the Treaty.
- 6 -
The Government of the United States of America understands that the
Government of Canada will provide a French version of its note, equally
valid, within 60 days of the date of its note.
Please accept, Madam, the renewed assurances of my high
consideration.

260724,Details About the Key Elements Agreed Between the United States and Canada Regarding Modernization of the Columbia River Treaty Regime,"This web page provides supplemental details regarding the “Summary of the Agreement in Principle to Modernize the Columbia River Treaty Regime,” available at https://www.state.gov/summary-of-the-agreement-in-principle-to-modernize-the-columbia-river-treaty-regime/

*The term “agreement in principle” refers to a milestone in negotiations. Elements of an agreement in principle do not have the force of law. It means the United States and Canada have reached a meeting of the minds on core issues and have a roadmap for drafting text of a treaty amendment and related arrangements.

Preplanned Flood Control: Following entry into force, Canada will provide the United States with 3.6 MAF of preplanned flood risk management (FRM) storage at Arrow Lakes. The United States and Canada are working to identify arrangements to implement the preplanned FRM for the upcoming flood season (spring of 2025).
Compensation to Canada for Flood Control: Annual payments will be made to Canada
1) Preplanned FRM payments are anticipated to be $37.6 million and indexed to inflation, using the consumer price index (CPI), through 2044. This compensation will be owed the first year Canada provides the preplanned FRM.
2) The United States also recognizes that we receive additional benefits from preplanned FRM in Canadian reservoirs and will provide an additional $16.6 million to Canada annually once the modernized agreement enters into force, indexed to inflation using the CPI, through 2044.
Canadian Entitlement: The Canadian Entitlement (CE) for the current (2023-2024) operating year was 1141 Megawatts (MW) in hydropower generation capacity and 454 average MW of energy. The following box is the scheduled glidepath of the CE, which reduces the CE at the beginning of the 2024-2025 operating year (beginning 8/1/24), stabilizing in 2033-2034 at 550 MW of capacity and 225 aMW of energy, and ending in 2044.

2043	550	225
2044	550	225
The CE may be further reduced, depending on how much flexibility Canada elects to use, as detailed in the following section.

Canadian Flexibility: The Treaty requires Canada and the United States to annually coordinate 15.5 million acre-feet (MAF) of reservoir storage space behind Canadian Treaty dams to optimize hydropower generation in both countries.
Canada can elect to reduce the coordinated storage to a minimum of 11.5 MAF in each year through 2039, and 10.5 MAF from 2039-2044 for their own domestic purposes.
For every MAF coordinated storage is reduced, the CE that the United States is required to deliver to Canada will be reduced by 6.5 percent.
Transmission: The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and Powerex (BC Hydro’s energy marketing and trading arm) will enter into an agreement to allow Powerex to assume (in a manner consistent with BPA’s transmission tariff that applies to other BPA contract-holders) and pay for existing transmission capacity, currently held by BPA to deliver the Canadian Entitlement.
New Transmission: BPA and Powerex will conduct a study on expansion of new transmission as envisioned in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-58), and on the basis of that study, BPA will determine whether to proceed on necessary domestic processes to implement the expansion as authorized in the IIJA.
Tribal and Indigenous Advisory Body: The United States and Canada will form an indigenous-led body that will provide recommendations on how Treaty operations can better support ecosystem needs.
Flows for Salmon: Canada will provide 1 MAF of water flows in all years and an additional 0.5 MAF in dry years to support salmon survival and migration.
Salmon Reintroduction: The United States and Canada acknowledge that the Tribes and Indigenous Nations on each side of the border are conducting salmon reintroduction studies and will coordinate on these studies. The goal is to prevent duplication of effort and to facilitate information sharing.
Kootenai/y Transboundary Collaborative Workgroup (KTCW): The KTCW will gather the governments in the Kootenai/y Basin to explore adaptive management in the region for the benefit of the ecosystem and other priorities. The KTCW will coordinate with the Joint Ecosystem and Tribal and Indigenous Cultural Values Body and other forums to integrate Kootenai/y issues with the broader Columbia River Basin.",USA

June 5, 2025 – Paris, France - Global Affairs Canada

This week, the Honourable Maninder Sidhu, Minister of International Trade, hosted a meeting with G7 trade ministers in Paris, France.

Minister Sidhu led an important discussion on the G7’s role in contributing to a trade environment that supports our shared goals of driving economic growth, creating good-paying jobs, and building long-term prosperity. The G7 trade ministers engaged on pressing issues that are impacting the global economy.

Minister Sidhu reaffirmed Canada’s commitment to the rules-based global trading system and the principles that underpin it. He highlighted the need for open, stable markets that ensure predictability amidst economic uncertainty, which is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises disproportionately affected by trade disruptions.

The minister also emphasized the importance of addressing the impacts of non-market policies and practices on our workers, businesses and economies.

“While the rules-based global trading system continues to face complex and evolving challenges, it is the foundation of economic security and prosperity. The G7 is a vital forum to address the challenges that affect not only its members’ economies, but also the global economy. I will continue to work closely with my G7 counterparts to support Canadian businesses of all sizes in finding trade opportunities in diverse markets and to build Canada as the strongest economy in the G7.”

290525,Joint statement of the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team on the first report covering Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-Russia military cooperation,"Statement
May 29, 2025 – Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

Today, the governments of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, United Kingdom and United States issued the following statement:

“We, the participating states of the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT), released today its first report. This multilateral mechanism was established in October 2024 to monitor and report on the implementation of United Nations sanctions measures on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The report is available on the official MSMT website (https://msmt.info).

“The report, which focuses primarily on unlawful DPRK-Russia military cooperation including arms transfers and Russia’s training of DPRK troops, consolidates information provided by MSMT participating states on violations and evasions of sanction measures stipulated in relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). The report also contains information provided by open-source intelligence organizations.

“This report is a product of our efforts to address the monitoring gap arising from the disbandment of the UN Security Council’s 1718 Committee Panel of Experts in April 2024, which was caused by Russia’s veto in March 2024. The report will assist with the full implementation of UN sanctions by the international community. The opportunity for dialogue to reestablish the Panel of Experts as a central element of the UN sanctions framework remains open, provided the panel is restored to the full form it had prior to disbandment.

“With the release of the first MSMT report, we underscore once again our shared determination to fully implement relevant UNSCRs. We urge the DPRK to engage in meaningful diplomacy, and call on all states to join global efforts to maintain international peace and security in the face of ongoing threats from the DPRK and those that facilitate its illicit activities in contravention of relevant UNSCRs.

“We will continue our efforts to monitor the implementation of UNSCRs on the DPRK and raise awareness of ongoing attempts to violate and evade UN sanctions.”",Canada

060525,Tribunal Issues Determination—Renewable Diesel from the United States,"News release
Ottawa, Ontario, May 5, 2025—The Canadian International Trade Tribunal today determined that the evidence does not disclose a reasonable indication that the dumping and subsidizing of renewable diesel from the United States of America have caused injury or are threatening to cause injury to the domestic industry. Therefore, the Tribunal terminated its preliminary injury inquiry.

The Tribunal’s inquiry was conducted pursuant to the Special Import Measures Act as a result of the initiation of dumping and subsidizing investigations by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Having determined that there was no reasonable indication that the alleged dumping and subsidizing have caused or threaten to cause injury or retardation, the CBSA will terminate its dumping and subsidizing investigations and the Tribunal will not initiate a final injury inquiry.

The Tribunal is an independent quasi-judicial body that reports to Parliament through the Minister of Finance. It hears cases on dumped and subsidized imports, safeguard complaints, complaints about federal government procurement and appeals of customs and excise tax rulings. When requested by the federal government, the Tribunal also provides advice on other economic, trade and tariff matters.",Canada

160425,G7 Foreign Ministers’ statement marking two years since the beginning of the devastating war in Sudan,"Statement
April 15, 2025 – Ottawa, Ontario – Global Affairs Canada

We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, unequivocally denounce the ongoing conflict, atrocities and grave human rights violations and abuses in Sudan, as the world marks two years since the beginning of the devastating war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

As a direct result of the actions of the SAF and the RSF, the people of Sudan, especially women and children, are enduring the world’s largest humanitarian and displacement crises, and continued atrocities, including widespread conflict-related sexual violence, ethnically motivated attacks and reprisal killings. These must end immediately.

We strongly condemn the RSF attacks carried out in and around El Fasher on the Zamzam and Abu Shouk IDP camps, which have caused numerous casualties, including humanitarian workers. Civilians must be protected and allowed safe passage.

As famine continues to spread across Sudan, G7 members are disturbed by reports of the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and reiterate that such actions are prohibited under international humanitarian law.

We call on the warring parties to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law and their commitments under the Jeddah Declaration, which include the crucial responsibility to distinguish at all times between civilians and combatants and between civilian objects and military targets.

We call on all parties to the conflict to lift impediments to effective crossline humanitarian assistance, provide assurances of safety and security for local and international humanitarian actors, and allow humanitarian access through all border crossings into Sudan, including through South Sudan and Chad. We recognize the important role of Emergency Response Rooms in providing for and protecting civilians and call for their protection. We further call on all parties to refrain from attacks on critical infrastructure that civilians rely upon, including dams and telecommunications systems.

We call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire and urge both the SAF and the RSF to engage meaningfully in serious, constructive negotiations. All external actors must cease any support that further fuels the conflict, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles adopted at the International Humanitarian Conference for Sudan and Neighbouring Countries in Paris in 2024 and the United Nations arms embargo on Darfur. We condemn all violations and unlawful attacks by the SAF, the RSF, and their allied militias.

For sustainable peace in Sudan, any resolution to the conflict must be rooted in the voices of Sudanese civilians. Women, youth, and civil society must be meaningfully included in all peace processes.

We reaffirm our support for a democratic transition and express our solidarity with the people of Sudan in their efforts to shape the future of their country that reflects their aspirations for freedom, peace and justice.

The sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Sudan are paramount. 

G7 members remain committed to deepening collective diplomatic efforts to bring about an end to the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and secure an end to the conflict, including through the London Sudan Conference.",Canada

We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, express deep concern about China’s provocative actions, particularly the recent large-scale military drills around Taiwan.

These increasingly frequent and destabilizing activities are raising cross-Strait tensions and put at risk global security and prosperity.

G7 members and the larger international community have an interest in the preservation of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. We oppose any unilateral actions to threaten such peace and stability, including by force or coercion.

G7 members continue to encourage the peaceful resolution of issues through constructive cross-Strait dialogue.",Canada
140325,G7 Foreign Ministers’ Declaration on Maritime Security and Prosperity,"Statement
March 14, 2025 – Charlevoix, Québec - Global Affairs Canada

1. We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, reaffirm the G7’s steadfast commitment to contribute towards a free, open, and secure maritime domain based on the rule of law that strengthens international security, fosters economic prosperity, and ensures the sustainable use of marine resources.

2. Maritime security and prosperity are fundamental to global stability, economic resilience, and the well-being of all nations, and the conservation and sustainable use of ocean ecosystems is essential to all life on Earth. Over 80% of global trade is transported by sea, and 97% of global data flows through submarine cables. Disruptions to maritime routes pose a direct threat to international food security, critical minerals, energy security, global supply chains, and economic stability. We express deep concern over the growing risks to maritime security, including strategic contestation, threats to freedom of navigation and overflight, and illicit shipping activities. State behaviour in these areas has increased the risk of conflict and environmental damage, and imperils all nations’ prosperity and living standards, especially for the world’s poorest. 

3. We recognize the role of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the legal framework for governing all activities in the oceans and the seas.

4. We recall the G7 Statements on Maritime Security adopted in Lübeck (2015) and Hiroshima (2016). We welcome related work presently underway through other G7 ministerial tracks and working groups, on a range of issues including securing undersea cable networks and combating abandoned fishing gear. We welcome, as well, G7 work relating to transnational organized crime and terrorism that touches on the maritime domain, including in relation to piracy and armed robbery at sea, trafficking in persons, and strengthening the maritime law enforcement capabilities of coastal states. We acknowledge the importance of regional maritime security frameworks, to support coastal states to address collectively threats to their maritime security. We welcome existing initiatives, such as the G7++ Friends of the Gulf of Guinea (G7++ FoGG, that Canada chairs this year), which has been the primary forum for dialogue among G7 members and partners on maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea.

Emerging Threat on Safe Seas and Freedom of Navigation and Overflight

5. Enhancing Stability: We underscore the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight and other internationally lawful uses of the high seas and the exclusive economic zones as well as to the related rights and freedoms in other maritime zones, including the rights of innocent passage, transit passage and archipelagic sea lanes passage, as provided for under international law. We share a growing concern at recent, unjustifiable efforts to restrict such freedom and to expand jurisdiction through use of force and other forms of coercion, including across the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea, the Red Sea, and the Black Sea. We condemn China’s illicit, provocative, coercive and dangerous actions that seek unilaterally to alter the status quo in such a way as to risk undermining the stability of regions, including through land reclamations, and building of outposts, as well as their use for military purpose. In areas pending final delimitation, we underline the importance of coastal states refraining from unilateral actions that cause permanent physical change to the marine environment insofar as such actions jeopardize or hamper the reaching of the final agreement, as well as the importance of making every effort to enter into provisional arrangements of a practical nature, in those areas. We condemn, as well, dangerous vessel maneuvers, the indiscriminate attacks against commercial vessels and other maritime actions that undermine maritime order based on the rule of law and international law. We reiterate that the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on 12 July 2016 is a significant milestone, which is legally binding upon the parties to those proceedings and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between the parties. We reaffirm that our basic policies on Taiwan remain unchanged and emphasize the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to international security and prosperity. We welcome the resumption of exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Freedom of navigation for commercial shipping in the Black Sea must be upheld.

6. Attempts to Change the Status Quo by Force: We oppose unilateral attempts to change the status quo, in particular by force or coercion including in the East and South China Seas. We undertake to implement means through which to track systematically and report on attempts to change the status quo by force and by the establishment of new geographical facts, including through coercive and dangerous actions on the oceans and seas that might threaten regional and international peace and security.

7. Protecting Critical Maritime and Undersea Infrastructure: We are seized of the fact that vital energy and telecommunications infrastructure under the oceans and seas connects our economies and is vital to our prosperity. We recall the G7 Joint Statement on Cable Connectivity for Secure and Resilient Digital Communications Networks (2024) and the New York Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea Cables in a Globally Digitalized World (2024). We share a growing concern that undersea communications cables, subsea interconnectors and other critical undersea infrastructure have been subject to critical damage through sabotage, poor seamanship or irresponsible behaviour which have resulted in potential internet or energy disruption in affected regions, delays in global data transmission, or compromised sensitive communications. We will enhance our cooperation with industry to mitigate risks, reduce bottlenecks to operational tasks while strengthening repair capacities in order to improve the overall resilience of critical undersea and maritime infrastructure. In this respect, we welcome the EU Action Plan on Cable Security adopted in February 2025 by the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

8. Maritime Crime: Maritime crime, including piracy, armed robbery at sea, maritime arms trafficking and sanctions evasion, human trafficking, illegal drug trafficking and Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated (IUU) fishing, continues to impede maritime security, freedom of navigation, and our economy and prosperity. We have been working together to tackle these maritime crimes, but maritime illegal activities have extended into new areas, to become an urgent issue to be addressed. We welcome the G7 Action Plan to combat migrant smuggling adopted under Italy’s 2024 G7 Presidency.

9. Protecting Freedom of Trade: In the past year, indiscriminate Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have endangered maritime security of vessels and their crews, disturbed international trade, and exposed neighboring countries to environmental hazards. Enabled by Iran’s military, financial, and intelligence support, these illegal attacks have also contributed to increased tension in the Middle East and Yemen, with severe repercussions on the intra-Yemeni peace process. The vessel “Galaxy Leader” seized by the Houthis must be released immediately. We appreciate the efforts of all those countries that have engaged to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, protecting crucial shipping lanes and helping to restore regular flows of trade through the Suez Canal connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In this regard, we commend the efforts of EU's maritime operation “Aspides” and U.S.-led operation “Prosperity Guardian”.

Safe Shipping and Supply Chain Security

10. Curtailing Unsafe and Illicit Shipping Practices: The rise of unsafe and illicit shipping practices, including fraudulent registration and registries, poses a significant threat to global trade and environmental sustainability.  We are concerned that unsafe and illicit shipping imposes heavy costs on industry, governments and citizens. Russia’s ability to earn revenue has been sustained through its extensive effort to circumvent the G7+ oil price cap policy through its shadow fleet of often older, underinsured, and poorly maintained ships that routinely disable their automatic identification systems or engage in “spoofing” to avoid detection and circumvent international safety, environmental, and liability rules and standards. North Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and evade sanctions, particularly through its illicit maritime activities, including prohibited ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum and other UN-banned commodities. Through G7 coordination, we have exposed North Korea uses of “dark” vessels – those that engage in illicit activity – to circumvent United Nations Security Council mandated sanctions. Russia and North Korea are strengthening their economic relations including through maritime routes, such as the reported transfer of petroleum products from Russia to North Korea. Unregulated, “dark” vessels undertake IUU fishing, destroying marine habitats and depleting fish stocks, with negative impacts for biodiversity and food security. Unregulated, inadequately insured “dark” vessels also pose a high risk of maritime accidents, including in fragile ecosystems such as the Arctic and Antarctic. We commit to strengthening our coordination, amongst the G7 and with other partners, to prevent the use of unregistered or fraudulently registered, uninsured and substandard vessels engaged in sanctions evasion, arms transfers, illegal fishing and illicit trade. We encourage relevant International Organizations to improve maritime domain awareness by expanding satellite-based vessel tracking and establishing comprehensive data records of the movement of individual ships and of ship-to-ship transfers, as a means of identifying and tracking illicit maritime activities. We are also committed to capacity building of the countries in the region in law enforcement and Maritime Domain Awareness.

11. Shadow Fleet Task Force: We invite members of the Nordic-Baltic 8 (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden), and possibly others, to join participating G7 members in a Shadow Fleet Task Force to enhance monitoring and detection and to otherwise constrain the use of shadow fleets engaged in illegal, unsafe or environmentally perilous activities, building on the work of others active in this area. The Task Force will constitute a response by the participating States to the call by the International Maritime Organization in its Resolution A.1192(33) of 6 December 2023 for Members States and all relevant stakeholders to promote actions to prevent illegal operations in the maritime sector by shadow fleets and their flag states, including illegal operations for the purposes of circumventing sanctions, evading compliance with safety or environmental regulations, avoiding insurance costs, or engaging in other illegal activities.

12. Enhancing Maritime Supply Chain Resilience and Energy and Food Security: Maritime supply chains will continue to underpin the global economy, but these face a variety of threats, both present and future, stemming from both geopolitical tensions and environmental factors.  Maritime disruptions raise consumer costs, increase transit times, and can reduce demand in importing countries, which in turn means lower revenues and diminished competitiveness for producers in exporting countries. Such vulnerabilities in maritime transport can undermine energy and food security, particularly for developing nations reliant on stable shipping routes, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). We welcome maritime initiatives involving and supported by G7 partners intended to promote energy and food security, such as the Grain from Ukraine scheme, and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We invite cooperation with the African Union (pursuant to Africa’s Integrated Maritime Strategy 2050) and other relevant International Organizations to identify best practices for enhancing maritime supply chain resilience and for safeguarding energy and food security, including in times of geopolitical crisis. 

13. Promoting Safe and Resilient Ports and Strategic Waterways: Port ownership and operational control matter to national security, as foreign control or influence over critical port infrastructure can create vulnerabilities in trade, in defence and security, and in economic stability. Port resilience is also crucial to economic stability and global trade and yet ports face growing risks from environmental degradation, extreme weather events and geopolitical conflicts. Strengthening port security and modernizing infrastructure are essential to maintaining safe and efficient maritime trade. Ensuring that the ownership and management of strategic waterways and key maritime choke points are not vulnerable to undue influence by potential adversaries is also essential to national security. We underscore the importance of scrutiny of ownership structures and port management and resilience within our own national jurisdictions, including with regard to Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems, to ensure that adversaries do not gain leverage over supply chains, military operations, or the flow of strategic resources. We will work with partners and with relevant International Organizations to encourage robust cybersecurity standards for port ICT infrastructure, to increase resilience against malicious cyber incidents on maritime logistical networks, to reduce monopolistic power over key supply chain nodes, to promote secure and transparent port ownership, to limit unsolicited or undue foreign influence over critical infrastructures and strategic waterways, and to otherwise encourage greater focus on such potential vulnerabilities.

14. Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) at sea poses a significant hazard to the marine environment, to the safety of fishermen and other users of the maritime space, and to various marine economic activities. We commit to enhancing diplomatic efforts and to exchanging best practices among national authorities, relevant international and regional organizations, and relevant industry sectors to accelerate the clean-up of UXO from the seas and ocean.

Sustainable Stewardship of Maritime Resources

15. Strengthen Enforcement Against IUU Fishing: IUU fishing is a major contributor to declining fish stocks and to marine habitat destruction. It may account for a third of all fishing activity worldwide, at a cost to the global economy of more than US$23 billion per year and with negative consequences for fisheries as an enduring economic asset, including for developing countries. We welcome the Canadian-led Dark Vessel Detection System in Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and members of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and would see value in replicating the model to support other partners whose fisheries are under threat from IUU fishing. We recognize that data sharing and transparency play a key role in this fight by exposing bad actors and that technological advances can support a robust Monitoring, Control and Surveillance and enforcement landscape. We encourage further progress in addressing IUU fishing, working with and through relevant International Organizations to establish and strengthen rules to sustainably manage fish stocks on the high seas and to improve the enforcement of these measures, including through the further development of detection technologies, aircraft patrols and high seas boarding and inspection of vessels, building upon the 2022 G7 Ocean Deal.

16. We welcome the Third UN Ocean Conference, in Nice, France, from 9 to 13 June 2025.

Partnerships

17. This G7 Maritime Security and Prosperity Declaration provides a framework for cooperation with non-G7 partners, including countries hosting major ports, large merchant fleets, or extensive flag registries as well as relevant regional and International Organizations, such as the International Maritime Organization and ASEAN. We would welcome robust cooperation with partners to take forward the goals set out in this Declaration, consistent with the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, under the efforts of the G7 countries, including a free, open, prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific region, to build a free and open maritime order based on the rule of law, and of commitment to the sustainable development of the world’s maritime spaces.

18. We welcome the cooperation on Coast Guard Functions, including the Global Coast Guard Forum hosted by Italy in 2025, as well as the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, which could also support the objectives of this Declaration.

130325,Statement from Minister Joly on negotiations between Ukraine and the United States in Saudi Arabia,"Statement
March 12, 2025 – Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today issued the following statement following a meeting between Ukraine and the United States that took place in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on March 11:

“Canada welcomes the news of negotiations between Ukraine and the United States, including a proposed temporary ceasefire and the resumption of U.S. intelligence sharing and security assistance to Ukraine. We also appreciate the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s role in hosting these discussions and supporting diplomatic efforts toward peace.

“A ceasefire could be – must be – the first step toward a just and lasting peace. With this agreement, Ukraine has once again shown its desire to end the war as soon as possible, and its commitment to being a constructive partner in the pursuit of lasting peace. The ball is now in Russia’s court to show that it is likewise ready for a ceasefire and to put an end to the bloodshed. The world is watching.

“I am heartened to see that the discussions between Ukraine and the United States placed particular attention on the critically important humanitarian dimensions of a ceasefire. This war has taken a deep toll, nowhere more than on the children forcibly taken from their families. Canada has helped champion these human dimensions of peace, and we cannot agree more with the value of a ceasefire including such elements as prisoner exchanges, the release of civilian detainees, and of course, the return of Ukrainian children.

“There is much more work to be done. Russia must now be consulted to see if they, too, will agree to a ceasefire, and beyond that, to negotiate a lasting peace, where Europe and Ukraine’s global partners must play a pivotal role. Canada stands ready to do its part.

“Since the start of Russia’s war of aggression, Ukrainians have endured unimaginable suffering. As we have shown time and again, Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine, and help to end this illegal invasion, prevent future aggression, and build a future where Ukraine is secure, stable, and free.”",Canada

March 12, 2025 – New York (New York) — Women and Gender Equality Canada

Mister Chair,

I acknowledge that we are gathered on the traditional territory of the Lenape people.

In 1995, something amazing happened - the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action set out an ambitious roadmap for achieving the equal rights of all women and girls.

Thirty years later, one would expect the conversation would be about how to go even further, yet, the reality is, and we can all see it, that women’s rights are in peril. Now is not the time to retreat, we must show our resolve, we must stand together in the face of adversity.

Over the last year, we have seen growing threats to gender equality, to the rights of women and girls, and to the freedoms of 2SLGBTQI+ communities.

Politicians are questioning the value of intersectionality and of supporting an inclusive society.

Sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back, while women’s health is being forgotten.

Discrimination, hate, and violence continue to fuel anti-feminist ideologies and are threatening the safety of women and girls globally.

And thirty years later, there are women still facing barriers that impact their education, career advancement, and their income. These barriers disproportionately impact Indigenous, Black, racialized people, 2SLGBTQI+ communities and women with disabilities.

We know that challenges to achieving equality are complex, but we also know that we cannot lose the progress that we’ve made.

Canada and its partners have been long-standing global leaders for advancing gender equality. In our efforts to end gender-based violence, Canada has made historic progress by implementing our National Action Plan to End Gender-based Violence, ensuring victims, survivors, and their families have access to the services they need, while at the same time addressing its root causes, including systemic inequalities and discrimination.

And amid increased attacks on people’s rights and growing global uncertainty, Canadian leadership in promoting and protecting human rights as a core element of Canada’s feminist foreign policy is more important now than ever.

That’s why on March 7, Canada signed the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women – also known as the Belém do Pará Convention.

Canada is also increasing efforts to help set women up for success by fostering women’s economic empowerment and unlocking access to finances, training, and mentorship.

We are also improving affordability and housing access while addressing systemic barriers to women’s employment.

Canada is investing in the early learning and childcare sector to help parents, particularly mothers, participate in the job market. Over the past 2 years, the labour force participation rate for women in Canada hit a record high, surpassing 85 per cent – providing further proof that when you support women, economies thrive.

To achieve true and lasting gender equality, Canada cannot do it alone, which is why through our Feminist International Assistance Policy, we are providing investments to build a more peaceful, more inclusive, and more prosperous world.  

Our progress has been a result of the incredible efforts of many partners. This includes Indigenous Peoples, civil society organizations, women’s and human rights organizations, as well as provincial and territorial representatives.

When women, girls, and gender diverse individuals are supported and safe, not only do they soar, but they inspire others to do the same.

Thank you. Merci beaucoup.",Canada
130325,Statement by Minister Ng on United States imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum,"Statement
March 12, 2025 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development today issued the following statement following the U.S. reimposition of Section 232 25 percent tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum as of March 12, 2025.

“Canada is deeply disappointed that the U.S. has chosen to reimpose these unjustified tariffs that hurt workers and businesses on both sides of the border. These unilateral tariffs violate the United States’ obligations under both the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement.”

“Canada is seeking formal consultations with the United States regarding the tariffs on steel and aluminum. This is the first step in both the dispute settlement processes of the WTO and the CUSMA.”

“Instead of imposing unwarranted trade barriers, the U.S. should work with Canada as a trusted trade partner. Canada will always defend its interests and stand up for Canadian jobs, industries and workers. We will continue to pursue all available avenues to challenge these unfair and detrimental trade actions”

Quick facts
The United States reimposed a Section 232 25 percent import duty on Canadian steel and aluminum imports entering the United States as of March 12, 2025.
Canada is a reliable source of both steel and aluminum to the United States, integrated into the supply chains of critical sectors such as automotive, aerospace and defence, advanced manufacturing and others.
A 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum will lead to significant cost increases for U.S. manufacturing, less competitive U.S. exports of finished goods, and ultimately higher prices for consumers.
Should consultations under the WTO or CUSMA not be conclusive, Canada could later decide to request the establishment of a dispute settlement panel under one of these fora.

010325,CBSA and RCMP joint investigation leads to criminal charges and the seizure of synthetic opioids more potent than fentanyl,"News release
Seizures as a result of the investigation.
Seizures as a result of the investigation.
February 28, 2025                                                                               
Mississauga, ON   

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are committed to intercepting and investigating smuggling attempts at our border and disrupting organized crime.

The CBSA and RCMP announced today that an arrest has been made in Mississauga, Ontario for possession and trafficking of narcotics, including Nitazenes. Nitazenes are a class of synthetic opioid which can be up to 20 times more potent than Fentanyl. They are used to “cut” street drugs in Canada, and their high potency can increase the risk of overdose, particularly when mixed with other substances.

CBSA border services officers at the international mail and cargo processing facilities in Mississauga, ON, and Vancouver, BC, seized multiple shipments of synthetic opioids arriving from China and destined to an address in Mississauga. Officers also intercepted additional shipments intended for international export. Using various investigative techniques, the CBSA’s Greater Toronto Area Region’s Intelligence Section provided the RCMP with the evidence required to obtain a search and arrest warrant.

On January 3, 2025, the RCMP’s Transnational Serious & Organized Crime seized over 5 kg of narcotics, drug paraphernalia, more than $120,000 CAD in cash and other proceeds of crime—including luxury watches and precious metals—from the accused’s residence in Mississauga.

As a result, the RCMP arrested Matthew Phan (36 years-old) of Mississauga, and charged him with:

Trafficking a Schedule I controlled substance to wit: Etonitazene, its salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues contrary to Section5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Trafficking a Schedule 4 controlled substance to wit: Fencamfamine, its salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues contrary to Section5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Possession of a Schedule I controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking to wit: Etonitazene, its salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues contrary to Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Possession of a Schedule I controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking to wit: MDMA, contrary to Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Possession of a Schedule I controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking to wit: methamphetamine, contrary to Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Possession of a Schedule 4 controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking to wit: Fencamfamine, its salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues contrary to Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Unlawful attempt to export a Schedule 1 controlled substance to wit: Etonitazene, its salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues contrary to Section 6(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Unlawful attempt to export a Schedule 4 controlled substance to wit: Fencamfamine, its salts, derivatives, isomers and analogues and salts of derivatives, isomers and analogues contrary to Section 6(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
Unlawful possession property obtained by crime, contrary to Section 354(1) of the Criminal Code.
Phan has not received bail and remains in custody.

Quotes
“This opioid seizure is yet another example of Canada's Border Plan in action and the effective partnership between the CBSA and the RCMP in stopping cross-border drug trafficking. Nitazenes pose a significant threat to public health, and these joint investigations are keeping our communities safe, both in Canada and abroad.”

– The Honourable David J. McGuinty, Minister of Public Safety
“Nitazenes are a lethal substance that pose a significant risk to the safety of Canadians, and the CBSA is committed to securing Canada’s border from drug threats like this one. In collaboration with the RCMP, our officers and investigators work diligently to keep these synthetic opioids off our streets. The CBSA executed over 3,000 narcotic seizures in the Greater Toronto Area in 2024, keeping over 10,000 kg of drugs out of our communities.”

– Lisa Janes, Regional Director General, Greater Toronto Area Region, Canada Border Services Agency
“This collaboration between RCMP Federal Police and the CBSA has resulted in a rapid response to protect the safety of our communities. We are very concerned that synthetic opioids are making their way onto our streets. This extremely toxic substance severely amplifies the risk of accidental overdose for all drug users. The RCMP is committed to battling transnational organized crime at all levels in Ontario, Canada and abroad.”

– Inspector Nicole Noonan, Officer in charge of Federal Policing - Integrated Response & Organized Crime, Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Quick facts
Canada is investing $1.3 billion to bolster security at the border and strengthen the immigration system, all while keeping Canadians safe. Information available on the Border Plan is available here: The Government of Canada’s Border Plan: significant investments to strengthen border security and our immigration system  

As part of Canada’s Border Plan, the CBSA has launched Operation Blizzard, a targeted, cross-country initiative aimed at intercepting illegal contraband arriving and leaving Canada, with a focus on fentanyl and other synthetic narcotics. 

From December 9, 2024, to January 18, 2025, the Canadian Integrated Response to Organized Crime (CIROC) Committee composed of Federal, Provincial and Municipal law enforcement agencies, conducted a national sprint aimed at disrupting illegal fentanyl production and distribution in Canada. 

The RCMP and the CBSA work closely in an investigative capacity, along with other domestic and international law enforcement partners, to combat the impact that cross border criminal activity is having on our communities.

The CBSA screens goods, including international mail and courier items, coming into Canada and examines more closely those that may pose a threat to the safety of Canadians.

The RCMP works with the CBSA to protect Canada from inbound and outbound criminal threats through criminal investigations and prosecutions related to narcotic smuggling.

Organized crime affects the daily lives of Canadians in many ways that you may not be aware of. It can affect the taxes you pay (tax revenue losses from contraband tobacco and alcohol); your car insurance premiums (higher auto insurance due to car thefts by organized crime rings); your banking fees (banks recovering fraud costs); even your safety and health (drug-related violence, faulty counterfeit goods and currency). In terms of economic-related crimes (e.g. credit and debit card fraud), it is estimated that organized crime costs Canadians $5 billion every year.

110125,Government of Canada’s response to the wildfires in California,"News release
January 10, 2025 - Ottawa, Ontario

The Government of Canada and all Canadians express their deep sadness at the devastating wildfires currently impacting southern California.

Canadians are grateful for the support and solidarity extended to Canada by the United States during our own challenging wildfire season last year. Team Canada stands ready to reciprocate that support during this time of need.

Canada has been working with the Provinces and Territories to ready its support. We have left no stone unturned and are exploring all avenues to offer our support to the people of California.

Canadian agencies, including the Canadian Armed Forces, the Canadian Coast Guard, Global Affairs Canada, and Natural Resources Canada, are actively engaged in discussions with the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC), and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and the City of Los Angeles to determine how best to assist in the response and recovery efforts.

Specific commitments currently under consideration include:

Canadian Armed Forces (CAF): The CAF is standing by with air transport capabilities to deploy provincial/civilian firefighting personnel and equipment.
Canadian Coast Guard (CCG): The CCG continues to work with our partners to offer support and to explore available resources that could be deployed to assist the response, if requested.
Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan): CIFFC and NRCan are working closely with the NICC and provincial/territorial authorities to rapidly identify which resources can be deployed and the availability of Canadian firefighting resources, including aircraft, to support the response.
Provinces in Canada are assessing how they can help California’s response; to date the following is also being mobilized, if requested:

Ontario: Is prepared to deploy Incident Command System (ICS) personnel, two CL-415 waterbombers, wildland and urban firefighters, along with associated equipment; approximately 200 personnel and approximately 120 kg of equipment per personnel.
Quebec: In addition to the two CL-415 water bombers sent in August 2024 to Los Angeles, the Québec government confirmed on January 10 the deployment of two other CL-415 skimmer airtankers to support firefighting efforts in California. It is considering providing additional water bombers and to having 60 Type 1 wildland firefighters available and on standby for deployment.
Alberta: Is sending a trained and experienced crew of up to 40 Type 1 wildland firefighters. Additional Type 1 firefighters, Incident Command personnel, and qualified support staff will be ready to go when requested. Alberta is also preparing water bombers and contracted night vision helicopters to be ready as well when requested.
British Columbia: Has a long-standing bilateral relationship with CAL Fire, and based on a request for support, is sending a team of senior technical staff to fill specialized incident command system functions.

- Graydon Smith, Minister of Natural Resources for Ontario
“The dreadful forest fire season in Québec in 2023 showed us the importance of collaboration and mutual aid. We were able to rely on several partners the world over that loaned us equipment and staff. The Québec government’s contribution, through the SOPFEU, to help our neighbours in California demonstrates our friendship with them in these trying times.”

030125,The CBSA announces first Canadian land preclearance operation in the U.S.,"News release
January 2, 2025         
Ottawa, Ontario                   

Today, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) announced its intention to launch its first preclearance operation in 2025. Preclearance supports the national security and economic prosperity of both Canada and the U.S. by facilitating the secure and efficient movement of people and goods across the border.

The initiative will have Canadian border services officers working at a shared facility at the Cannon Corners port of entry in New York (adjacent to the Covey Hill, QC port of entry). For the two-year duration of the operation, travellers entering Canada will go through Cannon Corners instead of the Covey Hill port of entry, which will be closed to travellers during that time.

At the preclearance site, Canadian officers will examine travellers and goods to decide whether they are admissible into Canada, as they currently do at ports of entry in Canada. This includes screening for dangerous goods, such as firearms and drugs, before they leave the U.S. While officers will be able to conduct most types of immigration processing at this site, claims for refugee protection cannot be processed at preclearance. Travellers seeking refugee protection in Canada will need to use a Canadian port of entry.

Updates on the initiative and launch date will be shared on the CBSA’s website and social media platforms.

Quote

“Today’s announcement demonstrates our shared commitment with the United States to bolster border security and streamline the flow of legitimate trade and travel between our two countries. Preclearance is yet another example of how Canada and the United States work together every day to intercept security threats early, while delivering large-scale economic benefits for Canadians and Americans.”

The Honourable David J. McGuinty, Minister of Public Safety

Quick facts
The Preclearance in the United States Regulations provide CBSA officers with the necessary authorities to carry out immigration services at preclearance sites in the U.S.

The U.S. currently has preclearance operations at eight Canadian airports. 

Canada is investing $1.3 billion to bolster security at the border and strengthen the immigration system, all while keeping Canadians safe.

271224,Ending flagpoling for work and study permits at the border,"News release
December 23, 2024
Ottawa, Ontario                    

As announced by the Government of Canada as part of Canada’s Border Plan, work and study permits will no longer be provided to flagpolers at a port of entry, effective December 23 at 11:59 pm ET.

Flagpoling occurs when foreign nationals who hold temporary resident status in Canada, leave Canada and, after a visit to the United States or St. Pierre and Miquelon, re-enter to access immigration services at a port of entry.

This practice has taken up significant resources at the border, diverting Canadian and American officers away from important enforcement activities and has contributed to wait times for cross-border travellers.

Immigration services at the border are meant for individuals arriving in Canada, not for those already in Canada. Applications and renewals for work or study permits need to be submitted through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Those who attempt to flagpole for a work and study permit will be told to submit their application to IRCC unless they meet limited exemptions.

These changes benefit Canada and the U.S. by allowing both countries to effectively manage border operations and maintain the integrity of our shared border.

Quotes
“This change will enable us to further streamline activities at our ports of entry and allow Canadian and American border officers to focus on what they have been expertly trained to do – border enforcement.”

- The Honourable David J. McGuinty, Minister of Public Safety
“A strong Canada-U.S. relationship keeps people and goods moving safely while protecting both sides of the border. Flagpoling is unnecessary and diverts resources from critical enforcement activities. This change will ease border congestion, improve fairness for applicants, and enhance the efficiency and security of our borders.”

– The Honourable Marc Miller, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
Quick facts
Between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024, the CBSA processed over 69,300 flagpolers across Canada. Most of these requests occurred in the Pacific, Southern Ontario, and Quebec regions.

In very limited circumstances, work and study permits may still be granted at a port of entry to individuals who otherwise meet the definition of flagpoling. The exemptions include:

Citizens and lawful Permanent Residents of the United States of America;
Professionals and technicians under free trade agreements with the United States/Mexico, Chile, Panama, Peru, Colombia and South Korea;
Spouses or common law partners of professionals and technicians under free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea;
International truck drivers who hold a work permit, where required to depart Canada for the purpose of their employment and held maintained status as a result of applying for renewal prior to departure; and
Individuals who have a pre-existing appointment booked with the CBSA for permit processing.",Canada
211224,Joint Statement from the Tallinn Mechanism - Donors accumulate 200 million euros for Ukraine’s resilience in cyberspace,"Statement
December 20, 2024 – Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

Today, Global Affairs Canada issued the following joint statement:

“Ukraine has withstood Russia’s brutal full-scale invasion for over 1000 days. This war does not only take place in the trenches but also in cyberspace; it confirms that cyberattacks are an integral part of 21st century conflict and warfare, and cybersecurity is a crucial dimension of the overall resilience of society. Thanks to Ukraine’s own resilience coupled with the international assistance it has received, Ukraine has persisted despite these attacks and has kept its digital ecosystem functioning throughout the war. The recent targeting of Ukrainian state registries underscores the importance of supporting Ukraine’s digital infrastructure in a comprehensive and timely manner.

“In order to jointly coordinate and facilitate our support related to civilian cybersecurity in Ukraine, partners publicly announced the Tallinn Mechanism one year ago. The mechanism consists of Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The European Union and NATO support the mechanism and have been observers since its creation. 

“The Tallinn Mechanism is using world class cyber and digital expertise, from both the private and public sector, to protect critical national infrastructure and vital services through bolstered cyber defense capabilities to Ukraine, enabling them to detect and disable the malware targeted at them. This support ranges from frontline hardware and software to prevent malicious cyber activities, endpoint detection and incident response, and training of cybersecurity officials. The Tallinn Mechanism is also supporting the ongoing critical need for satellite communication terminals in Ukraine. All the requirements of Ukraine are validated by the Ukrainian government through its governmental working group.

“Since establishment, the Tallinn Mechanism has accumulated over 200 million euros in foreign assistance that strengthens Ukraine’s ability to address Russia's malicious behavior in cyberspace and will continue to seek new avenues for supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes.

“With its engagement, the Tallinn Mechanism sends a clear message: Ukraine has full support of like-minded nations and partner countries that will continue to assist Ukraine in protecting its civilian critical infrastructure against Russian malicious cyber activity. Russian activity has aimed to destroy Ukraine's digital ecosystem and cyber capabilities, as well as attempt to destabilize Ukraine's allies in the cyber domain. Russia’s activities demonstrate that it is a persistently reckless, aggressive, and irresponsible actor in cyberspace, in contravention of the consensus on UN framework of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.

“The Tallinn Mechanism countries remain committed to continuing assisting Ukraine now, during the war of aggression, as well as in the long term.”

181224,Statement by Minister Ng on forced labour measures in 2024 Fall Economic Statement,"Statement
December 18, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, today issued the following statement regarding new measures to combat forced labour announced in the 2024 Fall Economic Statement:

“Forced labour is never acceptable anywhere in the world, and we must ensure that our global supply chains remain free of this abuse.

“Building on our commitment in Budget 2024 to eradicate forced labour from Canadian supply chains, the 2024 Fall Economic Statement announces our government’s intent to introduce legislation to create a new regime for supply chain due diligence. This will require government entities and businesses to scrutinize their international supply chains for risks to fundamental labour rights and take action to resolve these risks. A new oversight agency will be created to ensure ongoing compliance.

“We are also strengthening Canada’s ban on imports of goods produced with forced labour by introducing legislative amendments that increase the onus on importers to demonstrate their supply chains are free of forced labour. To implement these new measures, our government will provide $25.1 million over 2 years to Global Affairs Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

“These decisive actions demonstrate our government’s commitment to ethical trade practices and protecting workers’ rights while ensuring Canadian businesses can compete on a level playing field. We will continue to work with our partners to build more resilient and responsible supply chains.”

Quick facts
In July 2020, Canada implemented an import ban under the Customs Tariff, making it illegal to import goods wholly or in part produced by forced labour. This ban implemented Canada’s commitments under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement.",Canada
061224,Minister Joly launches Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy,"News release
December 6, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Arctic is experiencing major change. The shifting geopolitical landscape, evolving security threats and acceleration of climate change are impacting the Arctic in unique ways and highlight the need for strong Canadian leadership to respond to the changing reality in the region.

That is why the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced the launch of Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy (AFP). The launch of the AFP is the culmination of months of extensive engagement with territorial and provincial governments and Inuit, First Nations and Métis. The AFP was also informed by consultations with the Kingdom of Denmark; Finland; Iceland; Norway; Sweden; and the United States, Canada’s like-minded Arctic partners.

The AFP is a comprehensive diplomatic strategy for Canada’s engagement in and on the Arctic. It provides expanded presence and partnerships to address current needs and the flexibility to adapt to future challenges. This approach complements the 2019 Arctic and Northern Policy Framework (ANPF), and it will allow Canada to continue to safeguard its sovereignty, advance national interests and promote a stable, prosperous and secure Arctic based on a shared vision for the region’s future.

The AFP is composed of four foreign policy pillars: asserting Canada’s sovereignty; advancing Canada’s interests through pragmatic diplomacy; leadership on Arctic governance and multilateral challenges; and adopting a more inclusive approach to Arctic diplomacy.

The AFP will foster a more secure, prosperous and resilient Arctic for Canadians in the face of new and emerging threats to the region. It will also advance the priorities of territorial and provincial governments and the First Nations, Inuit, Métis, Modern Treaty and Self-Governing Partners who call the Arctic home.

Quotes
“We are in a tough world, and we need to be tough in our response. Competition is growing across the globe, and the Arctic is not immune. Many countries, including non-Arctic states, aspire for a greater role in Arctic affairs. The evolving security and political realities in the region mean we need a new approach to advance our national interests and to ensure a stable, prosperous and secure Arctic, especially for the Northerners and the Indigenous Peoples who call Arctic home.”

- Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs
“Climate change is increasing access to Arctic resources and shipping lanes, enticing nations to the region and heightening competition. This evolving environment creates new security challenges. Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these growing challenges with a focus on asserting our sovereignty in the North, while supporting prosperity for those living there. This new policy complements our defence policy, Our North, Strong and Free: A Renewed Vision for Canada’s Defence, which will see us expand our presence in the North.”

- Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence
“I am proud to support a new Arctic Foreign Policy that includes northern Indigenous knowledge, builds on the co-developed 2019 Arctic and Northern Policy Framework and reflects on the needs and priorities of the North. Placing Indigenous voices, knowledge, and wisdom at the foreground of both the policy and its implementation will ensure that the future of the Canadian Arctic on the international stage is shaped by the communities who have called the Arctic home since time immemorial.”

- Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs
“Inuit Nunangat, the Inuit homeland in Canada, makes up 40 percent of Canada’s land area and all of its Arctic coastline. Security and prosperity of Inuit Nunangat is a shared priority for Inuit and Canada, articulated through our work at the Inuit Crown Partnership Committee table. Building on our successful co-development of elements of the Arctic Foreign Policy through ICPC, we are committed to continue work to ensure that Inuit and Canada jointly deliver on the AFP’s strong ambitions.”

- Natan Obed, President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami
“Effective partnerships for a stronger, flourishing Arctic rely on co-development with Inuit, whether it be at home or abroad. Removing barriers for Inuit to connect with each other across borders and strengthening institutions, including the Arctic Council, are examples of what lies ahead. The Arctic Foreign Policy and policies like it must uphold Inuit self-determination, including our full and effective participation. We look forward to the work ahead with the federal government to make this happen.”

- Lisa Qiluqqi Koperqualuk, President of Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada
“The Yukon is stepping up as a key leader in Canada’s Arctic security. I welcome the Arctic Foreign Policy for strengthening Canada’s role in critical discussions and fostering collaboration in this vital region. With strategic investments, strong partnerships and northern voices included, the Yukon is ready to tackle challenges and support Canada’s leadership in the Arctic.”

- Ranj Pillai, Premier of the Yukon
“This new Arctic Foreign Policy reflects the evolving realities of our region and highlights the importance of collaboration between Canada, Indigenous governments, and Arctic and territorial partners. In the Northwest Territories, safeguarding Arctic sovereignty and security goes hand in hand with advancing opportunities for Northerners. By investing in resilient infrastructure, housing, and climate solutions, we can ensure a stable and prosperous future for those who call the North home, while reinforcing Canada’s leadership and security on the global stage.”

- R.J. Simpson, Premier of the Northwest Territories
“Nunavut welcomes Canada’s new Arctic-specific foreign policy and looks forward to partnering with the federal government to advance our country’s efforts regarding Arctic sovereignty and security. Our territory’s history and geography uniquely position Nunavut to play a strategic role in Team Canada’s diplomatic endeavours. We look forward to advancing the objectives of this policy through investments in transformative nation-building infrastructure that meet local community needs, forge opportunities for economic development and address reconciliation, and our country’s geopolitical interests in Arctic sovereignty and security.”

“The Arctic Athabaskan Council welcomes Canada’s new foreign policy on the Arctic which recognizes the autonomy and sovereignty of Indigenous Peoples. Only by working together towards common goals can we achieve our objectives.”

- Bill Erasmus, International Chair of the Arctic Athabaskan Council
Quick facts
The Arctic region is central to Canada’s national identity, prosperity and security. The Canadian Arctic covers 40% of Canada’s territory and more than 70% of its coastline and is home to many Canadians, including Indigenous Peoples, who have inhabited this land since time immemorial.

One of the core priorities for the Arctic Foreign Policy is to deepen cooperation across the North American Arctic. The North American Arctic encompasses the vast northern territories of three countries: Alaska (the United States) in the west; northern Canada in the centre; and Greenland (the Kingdom of Denmark) in the east. The relationships in this region are unique due to geographical proximity and the ancestral relations that exist among Indigenous Peoples.

Global Affairs Canada is responsible for coordinating and leading the international aspects of Canada’s engagement in and on the Arctic. Canada is an active member of the Arctic Council, the main international forum for Arctic cooperation.

The Arctic Foreign Policy builds on the International chapter of the ANPF, launched in 2019. The Framework was co-developed with territorial and provincial governments and Indigenous Peoples and is still very relevant and continues to be implemented.

131124,Canada signs new partnership agreement with United States and Finland to produce Arctic and polar icebreakers,"News release
November 13, 2024 - Washington D.C. - Public Services and Procurement Canada

In an increasingly complex world, the security threats faced by Canada are rapidly changing, none more so than in the Arctic. The warming Arctic is becoming increasingly navigable and opening a new arena of competition that our adversaries are eager to exploit. In response to these challenges, Canada must assert its Arctic sovereignty and work alongside allies to protect its interests in the North.

Today, the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Quebec Lieutenant, joined by Alejandro Mayorkas, United States (U.S.) Secretary of Homeland Security, and Wille Rydman, Finland’s Minister of Economic Affairs, signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding to establish the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE Pact).

This landmark partnership will enhance industry collaboration among our countries, coordinate expertise and strengthen our abilities to produce best-in-class polar vessels, including icebreakers. The ICE Pact will allow new equipment and capabilities to be produced more quickly. This includes setting up a system to rapidly exchange information on these icebreakers, keeping construction cost-and-time efficient. Through the ICE Pact, Canada, the U.S. and Finland will also work together on a joint workforce-development program to ensure that the workers building these vessels have the skills and training required. By jointly developing and producing world-class Arctic and polar icebreakers, we are laying the foundation for a competitive shipbuilding industry.

This increased cooperation will create thousands of good middle-class jobs, grow our economy, empower scientific research, and help uphold security and sovereignty in the Arctic. This partnership will be the groundwork for like-minded nations to increase their polar capabilities in the Arctic and Antarctic regions for generations to come. The ICE Pact is a win for our workers, our shipbuilding industry and our security, and it is a testament to the strength of allied cooperation in addressing shared challenges. Canadian shipyards will continue building polar icebreakers and other Arctic and polar capabilities under the National Shipbuilding Strategy (NSS).

The Arctic and North are integral parts of our country, home to 150,000 Canadians and generations of Indigenous communities. With transformative agreements like the ICE Pact, and through Our North, Strong and Free, Canada is ramping up investments in defence and security. Our investments, which will help us reach the North Atlantic Treaty Organization defence pledge, include $218 million for new Northern Operational Support Hubs in the Arctic, $18.4 billion to acquire a more modern tactical helicopter capability, $307 million for airborne early warning aircraft to detect airborne threats sooner, and $1.4 billion for specialized maritime sensors to defend Canada from underwater threats on all 3 coasts. We will always work with allies to protect our country, our continent and the rules-based international order.

Quotes
“As Arctic nations, it’s imperative that Canada, Finland and the United States invest in the production of icebreakers to protect our sovereignty in the North. The ICE Pact agreement will strengthen shipbuilding in Canada and will be essential in creating and maintaining good middle-class jobs. By working together, we are supporting national security and climate interests in the Arctic for the collective benefit of all 3 countries.”

The Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos
Minister of Public Services and Procurement and Quebec Lieutenant
“Through this enhanced trilateral partnership between Canada, the U.S. and Finland, our governments are committed to building world-class Arctic and polar icebreakers. This collaboration will drive innovation, share expertise and strengthen Canada’s shipbuilding sector, while ensuring our nations are better prepared to tackle the unique challenges of the Arctic and polar regions.”

The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne
Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry
“Today’s signing represents our commitment to working with international Arctic partners on the construction of polar icebreakers. Through increased information sharing and joint learning opportunities, the ICE Pact will help us ensure we’re building the highest-quality polar icebreakers for our future Canadian Coast Guard fleet.”

The Honourable Diane Lebouthillier
Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard
“Canada’s Arctic region is warming at 4 times the global average, making the region more accessible to our adversaries who have growing capabilities and regional military ambition. Like-minded nations need to work together to ensure the Arctic and polar regions remain peaceful, cooperative and prosperous. This agreement between Canada, the United States and Finland will increase cooperation between our 3 nations and will support our collective economic, climate and national security priorities in the Arctic.”

The Honourable Bill Blair
Minister of National Defence
Quick facts
The Canadian Coast Guard currently has 18 icebreakers of varying sizes and capabilities, making it the second-largest icebreaking fleet in the world.

The information and best practices that Canada, the U.S. and Finland gain through the ICE Pact will help inform current and future work on icebreaking capabilities built under the National Shipbuilding Strategy.

In May 2021, Canada announced the construction of 2 new polar icebreakers under the NSS at Seaspan’s Vancouver Shipyards Co. Ltd. and Chantier Davie Canada Inc. Both polar icebreakers will have capacity and abilities beyond those of Canada’s current largest icebreaker, the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Louis S. St-Laurent.

The construction of the polar icebreakers will generate approximately 300 jobs per vessel at the shipyards and 2,500 jobs across the marine supply chain.

The construction of these new ships is in addition to the $17.49 billion in contracts already awarded to shipyards large and small across Canada under the NSS, which have resulted in the revitalization of Canada’s shipbuilding industry and the creation of thousands of jobs across Canada.

In addition to the 2 polar icebreakers, Canada is building 6 Arctic and offshore patrol ships (AOPS) for the Royal Canadian Navy, 2 AOPS for the Canadian Coast Guard, 6 program icebreakers and up to 16 multi-purpose vessels, all of which have varying icebreaking capabilities.

The NSS is a long-term, multi-billion-dollar program focused on renewing the Canadian Coast Guard and Royal Canadian Navy fleets to ensure that they have the modern ships they need to fulfill their missions.

Through contracts awarded under the NSS between 2012 and 2023, Canada’s marine industry is estimated to contribute close to $30 billion ($2.3 billion annually) to gross domestic product and create or maintain more than 20,400 jobs annually to the Canadian economy over the 2012 to 2024 period.

Through Our North, Strong and Free, Canada is making a focused series of investments to better protect the Arctic and North, and get defence spending up to 2%, including:

$218 million over 20 years for Northern Operational Support Hubs to support a greater year-round presence across the Arctic and North, and invest in multi-use infrastructure that also meets the needs of territories, Indigenous Peoples and northern communities where feasible
$18.4 billion over 20 years to acquire a more modern, mobile and effective tactical helicopter capability that will provide the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) with the speed and airlift capacity to assert Canada’s sovereignty and respond to natural disasters and emergencies throughout the country
$307 million over 20 years for airborne early warning aircraft that will vastly improve Canada’s ability to detect, track and prioritize airborne threats sooner, ensuring a faster, better coordinated response with the U.S. when required
$1.4 billion over 20 years to acquire specialized maritime sensors to conduct ocean surveillance, which will be used to monitor Canada’s maritime approaches, including in the Arctic and North, and will be a critical component of the CAFs’ ability to defend Canada from a growing range and sophistication of underwater threats, including vessel-launched missiles, underwater systems, ships and submarines, on all 3 coasts
$222 million over 20 years to build a new satellite ground station in the Arctic, which will improve our ability to detect, deter and respond to malign activities and to communicate those threats quickly with our most trusted partners",Canada

An initiative between Canada and partner countries to strengthen our ability to prepare for and respond to public health threats

October 23, 2024 | Ottawa, Ontario | Public Health Agency of Canada

Canada, the United States and Mexico have a strong and longstanding partnership, and are connected across many areas, including health, business and social relationships. This interconnectedness means that disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other threats to health security, can have impacts across all three countries. Through continued coordination and cooperation, we can support the health and well-being of our populations.

Today, the Public Health Agency of Canada, in collaboration with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Public Safety Canada and Global Affairs Canada, and their respective counterparts in the United States and Mexico, released the North American Preparedness for Animal and Human Pandemics Initiative (NAPAHPI).

NAPAHPI fulfills commitments made during the 2021 and 2023 North American Leaders' Summits to strengthen North America's regional health security by working together to mitigate and respond to public health threats. It also provides a flexible framework that will help North American partners collaborate to address the challenges of potential future pandemics or other public health threats that require a coordinated response.

The NAPAHPI complements the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) and other international mechanisms which seek to strengthen and protect global health security, and supports a One Health approach that considers the relationships between the health of humans, animals, and the environment.

Together, Canada, the United States and Mexico will advance NAPAHPI's goals by working on key areas for collaboration:

animal diseases with zoonotic potential;
epidemiological surveillance and laboratory diagnostics;
medical countermeasures;
public health measures;
medical supply chains;
health systems;
risk communications;
border health measures;
critical infrastructure;
risk assessment and foresight risk analyses;
joint exercises and training; and
sustainable financing.
Quotes
""Canada, the United States and Mexico have a long-standing friendship and history of collaboration. The North American Preparedness for Animal and Human Pandemics Initiative demonstrates what can be achieved when our three countries work together on a common vision. Through more effective coordination and collaboration, we can identify and implement actions that seek to protect the health and safety of our populations, while minimizing economic and social impacts.""

-- The Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health
""The United States is committed to strengthening health security and preparing for future threats. To be successful we must coordinate closely across governments, as well as with industry and community leaders – which is what this platform makes possible. Our nations cannot be strong unless they are healthy. That's why we will continue to work together on a sustained, durable strategy that improves health security for all.""

-- Xavier Becerra, Secretary of Health and Human Services
""This new framework for collaboration between Mexico, Canada and the United States on preparedness for animal and human pandemics is an example of the close cooperation between the three countries. The framework will help us address the challenges of One Health and adopt new technologies and practices in the North American region. Additionally, it will promote a shared vision for surveillance, early identification of risk factors, and the planning and implementation of cooperative and sustainable responses to health emergencies. This trinational effort will translate into more efficient protection strategies for our populations.""

-- David Kershenobich, Minister of Health
Quick facts
NAPAHPI replaces the 2007 North American Plan for Avian and Pandemic Influenza, and the 2012 North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza.

NAPAHPI builds on the history of this tripartite collaboration, as well as on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and other public health events over the past decade.

For nearly two decades, the three partner countries have met regularly to discuss, prepare for and respond to public health threats such as H1N1, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika, the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic, and more recently H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks.

NAPAHPI is led by a Senior Coordinating Body as a key decision-making forum and a Health Security Working Group as its technical arm, with members from the human health, animal health/agriculture, security and foreign affairs sectors.

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, today issued the following statement to announce that Canada will challenge the final results of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s fifth Canadian softwood lumber reviews.

“Today, Canada took the necessary steps to begin two legal challenges under the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s decision to increase softwood lumber duties: one contesting U.S. anti-dumping duties and the other contesting U.S. countervailing duties.

“In its most recent annual reviews of softwood lumber duty rates, the United States further increased the unfair and unjust duties on Canadian softwood lumber, hurting Canadian industry and jobs and increasing housing costs in both countries.

“Canada has consistently contested U.S. decisions imposing duties on Canadian softwood lumber products under CUSMA and NAFTA and at the United States Court of International Trade.

“In every meeting I have with Katherine Tai, United States Trade Representative, including only a couple of weeks ago, I emphasize the benefit of finding a mutually beneficial solution that creates greater opportunities in the forestry sectors in Canada and the United States. I will continue to advocate for Canada’s softwood lumber industry, its workers and the communities that rely on it.

140824,Statement by Minister Ng on U.S. Department of Commerce fifth review of duties on Canadian softwood lumber,"Statement
August 13, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, today issued the following statement on the final results of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s fifth administrative review of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on certain Canadian softwood lumber products:

“Canada is extremely disappointed that the U.S. Department of Commerce has significantly increased its unfair and unwarranted duties on softwood lumber from Canada, from 8.05% to 14.54%.

“Baseless and unfair U.S. duties on softwood lumber unjustifiably harm consumers and producers on both sides of the border. This latest measure will negatively impact workers and their communities. U.S. consumers and businesses that need Canadian lumber will bear the burden of these duties, making housing even less affordable for Americans.

“It is in the best interests of both Canada and the United States to find a lasting resolution to this long-standing dispute. We will always fight for the best interest of Canadians and continue to use all available avenues to vigorously defend the workers, businesses, and communities who rely on softwood lumber for their livelihoods. These include litigation under NAFTA and the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, at the U.S. Court of International Trade and at the WTO.”

Quick facts
The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) conducts a yearly review of its anti-dumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders.
Commerce initiated the fifth administrative reviews of its softwood lumber AD and CVD duty orders on March 14, 2023. It issued the preliminary results of these reviews on February 1, 2024.
Commerce issued its final results on August 13, 2024. The new combined duty rate that will apply to most softwood lumber exports is 14.54% compared to the previous rate of 8.05% from the fourth administrative reviews.
The new rate will be applied retroactively to exports made in 2022 and will apply to new exports of softwood lumber products to the United States from companies that were subject to the fifth administrative reviews.

190724,"Minister Ng advances Canada’s trade priorities at G7 Trade Minister’s Meeting
","News release
July 18, 2024 – Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

Canada and countries around the globe are facing global economic uncertainty. This includes challenges that destabilize international supply chains and threaten global economic stability and recovery. An open, inclusive, sustainable, and rules-based international trading system can help mitigate these challenges.

This week, the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, participated in the Italy-hosted G7 Trade Minister’s Meeting in Villa San Giovanni -- Reggio Calabria, Italy.

During the meeting, Minister Ng reiterated Canada’s strong commitment to an open, fair, inclusive and rules-based trading system, with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core. She also highlighted that countries, including Canada, are facing unfair competition from the increased use of non-market policies and practices that are leading to significant overcapacity, including in  electrical vehicle (EV) production. Minister Ng noted that Canada has launched public consultations on this issue to protect Canada’s auto workers and its growing EV industry from unfair trade practices from China.

Canada is committed to protecting and promoting fair trade to ensure there is a level playing field for industries and workers, including in Canada. Minister Ng and her G7 partners committed to stepping up efforts to address evolving threats to economic resilience and the increasing use of coercive economic tools. Minister Ng reiterated the importance of continuing a dialogue on economic resilience, as Canada becomes President of the G7 in 2025.

Minister Ng committed to working with her international partners to ensure that benefits from international trade continue to flow into all our economies. She highlighted diversification as a key strategy to achieve this goal with Canada building stronger trade connections with fast-growing economies like in the Indo-Pacific and Africa. This effort aims to strengthen economic partnerships and increase Canada's role in global supply chains.

Throughout her meetings, Minister Ng condemned Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable war of aggression against Ukraine, which has had significant economic and trade impacts globally, including  exacerbation of supply chain issues, energy and food insecurity, and high inflation.

Minister Ng and her G7 counterparts endorsed a joint statement on their commitment to advancing initiatives that foster global economic growth, address climate change, strengthen the rules-based international trading system and promote the resilience of global supply chains.

On the margins of the G7 meeting, Minister Ng met with WTO Director-General Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, with Jonathan Reynolds, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for Business and Trade , with Antonio Tajani, Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, with Robert Habeck, Germany’s Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, and with Ken Saito, Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, to advance trade priorities that will provide opportunities for Canadian businesses and workers.

160724,Media Freedom Coalition statement on transparency law in Georgia,"Statement
July 16, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The undersigned members of the Media Freedom Coalition express their deep concern about the declining freedom of media in Georgia.

The recently adopted Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence poses a threat to the democratic fabric of Georgia. Organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from foreign sources will be required to register as organizations that ‘pursue the interest of a foreign power.’ This would affect many media organizations and non-governmental organizations that play a vital role in civic engagement, promoting human rights and good governance and advocating for Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic integration. This ‘foreign influenced’ label, coupled with the potential for stringent financial fines and penalties, will severely undermine their operations and have negative repercussions on freedom of expression.

This is worrying for the future of democracy in Georgia, including the upcoming Georgian parliamentary elections. Independent, critical journalism is an essential foundation of a free, inclusive and democratic society. Creating and maintaining an environment for civil society organizations and organizations that safeguard media freedom is at the core of democracy.

Furthermore, we are deeply alarmed by the continuing threats, physical assaults and destruction of property that journalists and civil society representatives working in Georgia have experienced recently. We condemn all intimidation and violence against the free press and civil society, which remain indispensable to an effective and stable democracy. 

The member countries of the Media Freedom Coalition will always defend freedom of expression and media freedom. The undersigned members stand with the Georgian independent media and civil society organizations and will continue to support their pursuit of a democratic future and aspirations for integration with European and Euro-Atlantic institutions.

130724,The 2024 U.S.–Canada Cross Border Crime Forum (CBCF),"Statement
Canadian and U.S. officials deepen strong and collaborative partnership on issues of mutual concern, including law enforcement information sharing, malign foreign interference, combating gun and drug trafficking, and online and hate crimes.

July 12, 2024 - Washington

The United States (U.S.) and Canada have a longstanding and enduring security, law enforcement, and intelligence partnership that is centered on protecting public safety, consistent with rights protected by law. Today, to advance our shared goals, U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas hosted Canada’s Minister of Justice and Attorney General, Arif Virani, and Canada’s Minister of Public Safety, Dominic LeBlanc, in Washington, DC for the U.S.–Canada Cross Border Crime Forum (CBCF). This meeting is the third CBCF since it was reestablished by President Biden’s and Prime Minister Trudeau’s 2021 Roadmap for a Renewed U.S.-Canada Partnership.

Building on the success of previous CBCF meetings, including the Statement of Partnership to Prevent, Investigate, Prosecute, and Disrupt Cross-Border Crime, which was signed at last year’s meeting, the four U.S. and Canadian Officials (hereinafter “the Ministers”) discussed ways to enhance collaboration in the following areas:

Foreign Interference/National Security
The Ministers acknowledged the threat from hostile foreign actors, including in the context of electoral interference. Malign actors may seek to influence outcomes and undermine public confidence in elections in many ways. They may deploy efforts to subvert democratic processes, such as engaging in cyber-attacks and other interference activities against election campaigns and election infrastructure to disrupt election processes. They may seek to influence elections, including by covertly exploiting and fueling divisions within society; and this, in turn, may also help fuel coercive activity and harassment, and threats of violence toward voters, candidates, and election personnel. Both Canada and the U.S. agreed that fair and secure elections are cornerstones of democracy and emphasized the need to work together to combat any threats that seek to undermine it.

Malign foreign actors also have demonstrated an intent and willingness to use insiders, computer intrusion, or other means to steal trade secrets and sensitive technologies. This global problem requires a global response and Canada and the U.S. will continue to investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute espionage that threatens our economies and export control violations. In this vein, the Ministers agreed on the need to preserve the cross-border flow of data between allies and partners that is critical to our economic well-being, while maintaining the security of sensitive personal data.

The Ministers similarly reaffirmed their united front in protecting our democracies and the democratic process. A key tool in combatting the threat of transnational repression, as well as malign foreign influence and interference generally, is transparency through foreign agent registries; the U.S. discussed the use of its Foreign Agents Registration Act and related statutes, while Canada highlighted its newly passed legislation in this area, Bill C-70, An Act respecting countering foreign interference, which will establish a Foreign Influence Transparency Registry and update criminal law tools to better safeguard democracy. These efforts, along with investigations and prosecutions of transnational repression-related cases, will further enhance the ability of the U.S. and Canada to protect those living within our borders.

Law Enforcement Cooperation and Information Sharing
Canada and the U.S. continue to combat the devastation caused by fentanyl and synthetic opioids, by working together at disrupting the illicit supply chain, to include production and distribution and the importation of illicit precursor chemicals from China and elsewhere. Similarly, the violence wrought by firearms smuggled across the U.S.-Canada border requires continued efforts to target those responsible, including shippers and receivers, by seizing illicit firearms and tracing their origins.

Key in all these counter opioid and firearm efforts is enhanced information sharing between Canadian and U.S. law enforcement agencies, which has already led to successful operations. The Ministers applauded the advances in cooperation between U.S. and Canadian law enforcement since the last CBCF and underscored the need to build on and further operationalize prior Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to provide clear policy direction and training to ensure that institutional policies and practices maximize information sharing within the context of each other’s laws and regulations, and in accordance with recent MOUs. They plan to continue to work together to improve the operationalization and systemization of intelligence and law enforcement sharing at the border, with the goals of supporting interdictions and investigations, countering transnational organized crime, continuing to build the global coalition against synthetic drug threats, and disrupting the synthetic opioid and firearm supply chains.

In the context of enhancing information sharing, the Ministers also discussed the challenges associated with cross-border human smuggling that is occurring in both directions, and challenges in related investigations. Accordingly, the Ministers called on their officials to continue strengthening ways to gather and share information for the detection and investigation of organized crime groups and networks that target vulnerable people and engage in human smuggling. They also tasked officials to review information sharing case studies of border incidents and identify opportunities to further improve intelligence sharing, detection, and interdiction, in order to disrupt cross-border smuggling and investigate and hold accountable those involved.

With respect to law enforcement cooperation and information sharing at the border, the Ministers also considered their respective country’s approach to providing advance notification of sex offender travel, which remains a key tool in making informed admission decisions. Both countries will seek to maximize the sharing of sex offender travel notifications, in the interest of ensuring public safety.

Online Crime and Hate Crimes
The Ministers began their discussion of online crime by acknowledging the need to maintain tightly-controlled lawful access to communications content that is vital to the investigation and prosecution of serious crimes, including terrorism and online child sexual exploitation and abuse. 

The Ministers then turned to collective efforts to address the increasing prevalence of online child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The Ministers noted the increase in both countries of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated CSAM and the need for international engagement to combat this threat, to include law enforcement, non-governmental organizations, the technology industry, and others.

With respect to AI more generally, the Ministers acknowledged the benefits and risks posed by AI technology. Moreover, the Ministers recognized that AI crosses over multiple government equities, including criminal law, civil rights, and antitrust law, and recommended that this continue to be a focus of study by the CBCF.

The need for strategic and coordinated engagement between and among international partners was also discussed in the context of elder fraud and romance scams. The Ministers discussed avenues available to collectively identify and disrupt such schemes to prevent further victimization.

Canada and the U.S. also acknowledged the ways in which hate crimes erode communities. The Ministers noted with concern the increased number of attacks motivated by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of bias on both sides of the border and pledged to work together to address this issue.

The Ministers also welcomed the outcomes of the strengthened collaboration between their respective Access to Justice Offices over the past year, including on strategies to overcome systemic inequality and discrimination, as part of efforts to increase access to – and strengthen confidence in – the justice system. 

Conclusion
The Ministers plan to continue their close contact on all these critical issues, both in the context of the CBCF, and in other bilateral exchanges. They reiterated the strength, success, and depth of the security and law enforcement relationships along the Canada-U.S. border and the need to remain aligned. ",Canada

080724,Media Freedom Coalition statement on Evan Gershkovich's Trial,"Statement
July 8, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The undersigned members of the Media Freedom Coalition note with deep concern the trial of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia.

After more than a year of arbitrary detention, his trial – on baseless charges of espionage – is a deliberate attack on media freedom, and one that can only add to his family’s pain. Evan Gershkovich is an accredited reporter with a respected news outlet; his arrest, detention, and trial represent a disturbing hostility to press freedom in Russia.  Journalism is not a crime. When journalists are targeted because of their work, the world loses out on its most valuable sources of information; free inquiry and truth-seeking suffer; and journalists themselves are forced to run unconscionable risks.

Mr. Gershkovich’s case is, unfortunately, illustrative of the Kremlin's choice to launch a systematic assault on media freedom rather than allow honest reporting on its crimes in Ukraine and its repression at home. Dozens of journalists are imprisoned in Russia because of their work, including both Russian nationals and their foreign counterparts.  Many were targeted for their coverage of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. Hundreds more journalists have been forced into exile. And those who remain active in Russia face significant personal risk as well as the censorship of a government that fears truthful reporting above all.

The undersigned members of the Media Freedom Coalition condemn these deliberate efforts to undermine press freedom and freedom of expression in Russia. We urge the immediate release of all journalists who have been unjustly detained. And we call on all countries to uphold their obligations and commitments to human rights and the rule of law.

May 31- Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

“The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, the High Representative of the European Union, and the Secretary of State of the United States of America affirm that the recent sanctions designations by each of our governments represent a coordinated effort to hold the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Russia to account and to impose costs on actors and entities involved in the unlawful transfer of arms from the DPRK to Russia for use in attacking Ukraine. 

“Our governments stand in resolute opposition to these continued arms transfers, which Russia has used to strike Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, prolonging the suffering of the Ukrainian people. We are gravely concerned by the deepening DPRK-Russia cooperation in flagrant violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and condemn Russia’s veto of the UN Security Council resolution that would have extended the mandate of the UN 1718 Committee Panel of Experts. By the use of its veto, Russia has sought to deprive all UN Member States of the objective and independent information and guidance they need to implement binding Security Council resolutions concerning the DPRK, which all remain in effect. We call on the DPRK and Russia to cease unlawful arms transfers and urge the DPRK to take concrete steps towards abandoning all nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and related programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. We urge the DPRK to respond to the numerous and genuine offers to return to diplomacy, the only path to an enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula.”",Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, issued the following statement regarding yesterday’s decision by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Chapter 19 panel on U.S. countervailing duties on Canadian softwood lumber:

“Canada welcomes the panel’s decision that U.S. duties on Canadian softwood lumber are inconsistent with U.S. law.

“The Canadian softwood lumber industry is a critical and reliable partner to the United States, creating jobs and making valuable contributions to our deeply integrated North American supply chains.

“Although we are disappointed by certain aspects of yesterday’s decision, it is still an important step toward the elimination of U.S. countervailing duties and supports Canada’s long-standing position that U.S. duties on Canadian softwood lumber products are unfair and unwarranted.

“It is in the best interests of both Canada and the United States to find a durable, mutually acceptable resolution to this dispute, and Canada remains ready to work collaboratively toward that goal.”

Quick facts
Over the last 40 years, the U.S. lumber industry has frequently sought unwarranted U.S. government restrictions on Canadian softwood lumber imports through the application of U.S. countervailing and anti-dumping duty laws
In November 2016, the U.S. softwood lumber industry requested the initiation of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations, which led to the imposition of duties on Canadian softwood lumber products beginning in early 2017
Canada is actively defending its softwood lumber industry against these trade measures by challenging U.S. decisions imposing unfair duties on Canadian softwood lumber under NAFTA, the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, the WTO and the United States Court of International Trade",Canada
200424,CBSA phasing in CARM: launching internally for CBSA use as planned in May and later in the fall for trade chain partners,"News release
April 19, 2024

Ottawa, Ontario – Today, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) provided an update on its plans for the launch of the CBSA Assessment and Revenue Management (CARM) digital initiative, which will modernize the collection of duties and taxes for goods imported into Canada. 

CARM will launch internally at the CBSA on May 13, as planned, to advance the Agency’s compliance and enforcement efforts. However, as a result of strike vote activity now underway by the Public Service Alliance of Canada and the possible impact on the Agency’s operations in the event of a positive strike vote, it is the intention of the CBSA to reschedule the launch for trade chain partners to October 2024. This will ensure that the Agency can support partners as they start using CARM. Therefore, until the fall, trade chain partners will continue to operate as they have.

CARM is ready to roll out. However, the support of CBSA employees is critical to the successful implementation of CARM. By rescheduling its launch, the Agency is setting industry partners up for success. Given the links between CARM and other business mainframe systems in the CBSA and Canada Revenue Agency, the next scheduled window to migrate major IT changes is October 2024.

The CBSA held approximately 100 consultation and technical working group sessions, over 160 direct engagement events, and has completed multiple cycles of testing, including over 10 months of simulation with direct participation by CBSA employees and industry. Industry has worked to be ready with approximately 71,500 importers now registered in CARM – these importers represent over 92 percent of the volume of goods imported.

In addition to protecting and growing $40 billion a year in revenue for Canadians, CARM will provide a number of other benefits:

Eliminate cumbersome and time-consuming paper-based processes
Provide better tools that will allow the CBSA to focus its compliance and enforcement efforts on potential bad actors
Improve functionality for importers through the ability to enroll in commercial programs, submit accounting documents, and receive notifications through their CARM Client Portal account
The internal launch of CARM at the CBSA, starting on May 13, will allow the Agency to advance work towards the expected benefit of better compliance. The CBSA will use CARM to identify errors and discrepancies in duties and tax submissions, and begin to work with industry in these areas. These efforts respond to a study by the Auditor General of Canada, who had estimated that as many as 20% of goods coming into Canada were misclassified, resulting in a lesser amount of duty paid.",Canada
160424,"Canada’s delegation to UNPFII advocates for the enhanced participation of Indigenous Peoples, including the unique and diverse perspectives of Indigenous youth","News release
April 15, 2024 — New York, NY — Unceded territory of the Lenape – Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada

The strong voices of Indigenous youth are changing communities, challenging the status quo, and taking the lead in building a better, fairer, and more sustainable future for all people in Canada. Today, Indigenous leaders, youth, and community representatives, alongside Canadian federal officials and those from member states from around the world, came together for the opening of the 23rd session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII).

Over the span of 10 days, participants will gather as part of an ongoing international dialogue on Indigenous rights and issues across the globe. The Honourable Gary Anandasangaree, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, led Canada’s delegation to UNPFII, which includes First Nations, Inuit and Métis Elders and youth. This year’s theme, focused on emphasizing the voices of Indigenous youth, provides the opportunity for an inter-generational dialogue on a variety of topics, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Advocacy at the United Nations (UN) by Indigenous youth is essential given their diverse and valuable perspectives in areas such as enhancing the participation of Indigenous Peoples at the UN. Canada continues to support the goal of creating a new category for Indigenous participation at the UN since the issue was last negotiated in 2017.

To highlight the importance of dialogue, Minister Anandasangaree, the Tŝilhqot’in Nation, and the Indigenous Coordinating Body on Enhanced Participation co-hosted an event between Indigenous leaders and youth from across the globe. This event highlighted current efforts being made to promote the inclusion of Indigenous Peoples in global policy and decision-making and to ensure that the unique perspectives, knowledge, and wisdom of Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous youth, are brought to the forefront of international discussions.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action 66 calls for the federal government to establish multi-year funding for community-based youth organizations to deliver programs on reconciliation, and establish a national network to share information and best practices. Since 2019, Canada has invested in a five-year Indigenous youth pilot program, led by an Indigenous youth organization called Indigenous Youth Roots. Canada continues to empower Indigenous youth and promote greater inclusion in policy-making, and there is more to do. Indigenous youth also play an important role in the implementation of the UN Declaration Act Action Plan, which ensures sustained and continued efforts to uphold the human rights of Indigenous Peoples now and in the future. The active participation of Indigenous youth in the consultation and cooperation process for the UN Declaration Act Action Plan, including the measures that specifically respond to the rights of Indigenous youth, further supports the inclusion of Indigenous youth in transformational work that will move the dial forward on reconciliation. Meaningful work is underway, but there is more to do.

It is essential that Indigenous Peoples, including Indigenous youth, have the space to speak in their own voices on the issues affecting them and their communities, which will ultimately lead to better outcomes for all generations ahead.

Quotes
“I am truly inspired by the many courageous Indigenous youth from across the globe whom I have had the opportunity to listen to and learn from during my time at the Permanent Forum. To all the young people I met at the United Nations and beyond, I commit to help amplify your voices so you can be at the tables where decisions are made that impact you.”

The Honourable Gary Anandasangaree
Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations
“Being here at the United Nations is an opportunity to bring awareness and attention to the youth. There is a lot to deal with in the past but we need to look forward. Joining the UNPFII is about reaching out, connecting, and inspiring. We are giving hope for a brighter future for our youth.”

020424,The CBSA and U.S. CBP provide an update on the NEXUS program,"News release
April 2, 2024

Ottawa, Ontario

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) NEXUS program speeds up border crossings for frequent travellers from Canada and the United States. Since 2002, the bilateral trusted traveller program has supported communities and economic interests on both sides of the border by expediting the crossing of pre-screened travellers and allowing border officers to focus more attention on stopping illegal activities and criminals.

Work is underway to increase the NEXUS application fee from US$50 to US$120 effective October 1, 2024, subject to approval of regulatory amendments in the United States and Canada.

The current fee, set over 20 years ago, no longer covers the cost of the program. The new fee would reflect more accurately the cost of administrating the program and the investment required for future program improvements, including technology and infrastructure enhancements. This would work out to US$24 per year for the 5-year membership.    

The proposed increase would help keep up with the high demand for the program and continue to improve NEXUS. Since April 2023, we have received over 510,000 applications and completed almost 10,000 interviews every 2 weeks.

Applicants are encouraged to book their interview as soon as possible. Appointments are always available on the Trusted Traveller Programs System. Many enrolment centres offer next-day availability for scheduling interviews, allowing applicants to book their appointments quickly.

In anticipation of an increase in demand between now and October, the CBSA and U.S. CBP remain ready to process applications and will continue to make interviews available.

Over the past year, the CBSA and U.S. CBP have:

Reduced the inventory of NEXUS interviews by 25% since July 2022.
Expanded hours of service at enrolment centres in both Canada and the U.S. to increase the availability of interview appointments.
Introduced split interviews at land enrolment centres, offering additional interview options for applicants.
Reopened Canadian airport enrolment centres for two-step interviews.
Provided flexibility for applicants to complete the interview process, while encouraging them to complete their interviews as soon as possible.
Quick facts
Applicants who have submitted their application and paid the US$50 fee, but have not completed their enrolment interviews by October 1, 2024, will not have to pay the proposed US$120 fee.

The proposed fee aligns with the fee harmonization across other Trusted Traveller Programs administered by U.S. CBP.

The NEXUS program currently has over 1.8 million members, with the majority of members being Canadian.

NEXUS cards allow members to:

use self-serve NEXUS kiosks or eGates when entering Canada at nine major international airports
use dedicated vehicle lanes at 20 designated land border crossings
use U.S. Global Entry kiosks for entry into the U.S.
receive expedited clearance through CATSA security screening lines at major and select mid-sized airports in Canada
receive expedited clearance through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration Pre-Check lines at over 200 participating U.S. airports

March 12, 2024 – New York (New York) — Women and Gender Equality Canada

– Check against delivery –

I’d like to begin by acknowledging that we are gathered on the traditional territory of the Munsee Lenape.

Thank you to the Commission on the Status of Women, and to my colleagues here as well - I’m honoured to deliver this statement on behalf of Canada.

It’s no secret that these are unstable times – people around the world are struggling for survival and impacted by food insecurity, displacement, human trafficking, war, and lacking proper healthcare and reproductive care.

And we know that these issues disproportionally impact women, girls, and children – and they persist for generations.

Our position – Canada’s position - is that gender equality is non-negotiable. It is a fundamental human right, and it must be protected.

That protection must be rooted in solidarity between governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector.

I want to take a moment to recognize the young Canadian leaders that we are so honored to stand alongside. Their presence here gives us so much hope, these young women are not waiting for solutions – they are going out and creating their own – and I want to thank them for reminding us that equality and justice are something that we can achieve.

They know – and we all know – it isn’t by chance that the rights of women and girls are under attack – this regressive campaign is coordinated, and it does not stay within any one country’s borders.

Which is why we need to use forums like this to build up our unshakeable commitment to protect marginalized people, and more specifically, women and girls in all countries.

In Canada, we’re tackling these issues through a number of programs, and I will name a few.

We’re doing this through our National Action Plan to End Gender-based Violence, that is focused on preventing violence before it happens, because we know that women cannot succeed economically or socially, if they aren’t safe; and the 2SLGBTQI+ Action Plan to support the queer and trans communities in their time of need.

We’re also expanding our social safety net using a feminist lens, by implementing a National Childcare Program that will make daycare affordable; a National Pharmacare program, that will make contraceptives and diabetes medication free; a Menstrual Equity Fund, because no one should have to choose between being able to afford groceries or menstrual products; and a Disability Inclusion Action Plan, to make sure that people with disabilities have the same opportunities in our communities and in our workforce.

These programs weave gender equality into the very fiber of our values, of who we are as Canadians - and into our daily lives.

We know that even with this progress, we still have work to advance reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples, closing the gender pay gap and making sure there are more Canadian women in positions of leadership.

We also take seriously our role in the global community to promote and protect gender equality, which we do through Canada’s Feminist International Assistance Policy that places gender equality at its core and prioritizes supporting women’s rights organizations that are on the frontlines of fighting for gender equality.

And through our Women’s Voice and Leadership Program we provide support for women and girl’s education in developing countries – because when you educate a woman, you educate a nation.

We are very proud of being one of the leading advocates when it comes to investing in women’s and LGBTI rights organizations, and we intend to continue this long-standing Canadian tradition of standing up for equity and equality around the world.

To close, I want to remind everyone that young people are counting on us – it’s up to us to hear them, to see them, and to commit to never backing down from building a better, more equal world.

Thank you.",Canada

Considering the particular complexity of pollution concerns in this watershed, Canada and the United States have also asked the IJC to establish a two-year Study Board to convene experts and knowledge holders to conduct transparent and coordinated transboundary data and knowledge sharing.
These actions respond to partner interests in:

Gaining a common understanding of pollutants of concern within the Elk-Kootenay watershed;
Establishing mechanisms supporting transboundary data, information, and Indigenous knowledge sharing, science and monitoring, assessments of aquatic ecosystem health, and transparent progress reporting; and
Understanding and taking steps to reduce and mitigate the impacts of pollution.

The Government of Canada is committed to transparency in the collection and publication of data related to steel imports. Today, the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, announced that beginning November 5th, 2024, steel importers will be required to report “country of melt and pour” information to the Canada Border Services Agency when completing their customs declarations under Canada’s Steel Import Monitoring Program.

As part of a phased-in approach, steel importers now have the option to begin reporting data regarding the country where raw steel was first produced. This process will ensure Canada is working with the steel industry to support an effective and smooth transition to mandatory reporting in fall 2024.

Global Affairs Canada will analyze this data and publish reports on steel import trends.

February 16, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The United States, the United Kingdom and Canada remain deeply concerned about foreign information manipulation and other actions designed to undermine our democracies and human rights globally.

Foreign information manipulation is a national security threat that undermines democratic values, human rights, governmental processes and political stability. Given the borderless nature of information manipulation, we call on all like-minded countries committed to the rules-based order to work together to identify and counter this threat. Securing the integrity of the global information ecosystem is central to popular confidence in governance institutions and processes, trust in elected leaders and the preservation of democracy.

The present international system, based on international law and respect for territorial boundaries, is competing with an alternate vision defined by autocratic impunity. This alternate vision deploys foreign malign influence aimed at undermining our safety and security with disregard for universal human rights and the rule of law.

The time is now for a collective approach to the foreign information manipulation threat that builds a coalition of like-minded countries committed to strengthening resilience and response to information manipulation. We can do this through coordinated, whole-of-society solutions that work with experts, independent media and multilateral organizations to address these transnational security threats.

That is why, today, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada jointly endorse the Framework to Counter Foreign State Information Manipulation, which affirms our shared understanding of the threat and offers a holistic view of how to address the foreign information manipulation challenge. It aims to standardize our approach to this problem and build interoperable and complementary systems to resist this threat as technologies continue to emerge and adapt. The framework complements the high-level international commitments from the Global Declaration on Information Integrity Online and reinforces our joint efforts and commitment to protect and promote information integrity.

The United States, the United Kingdom and Canada intend to collaborate on building partner countries’ resilience to foreign information manipulation by advancing the framework’s key action areas: National Strategies and Policies; Governance Structures and Institutions; Capacity; Civil Society, Independent Media and Academia; and Multilateral Engagement.

The United States, the United Kingdom and Canada intend to jointly work on operationalizing relevant key action areas through new and existing multilateral mechanisms, such as the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, and in coordination with other like-minded partners and multilateral organizations.",Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, today issued the following statement regarding the United States International Trade Commission’s (USITC’s) determination on tin mill steel imports from Canada:

“Today, the USITC determined that imports of Canadian tin mill steel products did not cause or threaten to cause injury to domestic U.S. producers.

“Canada is pleased with this decision. Canadian tin mill steel producers are a critical part of our cross-border steel industry. They are reliable partners to the United States and contribute to our deeply integrated North American supply chains.

“A negative finding was the only justifiable outcome for the Canadian steel industry and its workers. Today’s announcement will further strengthen the unique Canada-United States trade relationship, built on a historical alliance and steadfast friendship. 

Quick facts
Canadian tin mill steel is commonly used to manufacture various everyday items, including cans for food, aerosol products and paint. Canadian producer ArcelorMittal Dofasco, based in Hamilton, Ontario, is 1 of only 4 tin mill producers in North America, playing a critical role in North American supply chains.
In February 2023, the United States Department of Commerce (Commerce) initiated an anti-dumping (AD) investigation on imports of tin mill steel from Canada and 7 other countries, further to a petition filed by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and the United Steelworkers. When conducting an AD investigation, Commerce examines whether non-U.S. companies are exporting their products to the United States at a price lower than what is charged in the exporting country, or below the cost of production.
In January 2024, Commerce made an affirmative final determination of dumping on tin mill steel from Canada and announced a final AD duty rate of 5.27% on these imports.
Final AD duties are only applied if the USITC determines that the allegedly dumped tin mill steel imports have caused, or threaten to cause, material injury to the U.S. industry. Since the USITC’s determination was negative, the investigations will be terminated, and any provisional AD duties collected from Canadian tin mill steel producers since August 17, 2023 will be refunded.",Canada
180124,Canada challenges U.S. decision to maintain softwood lumber duties,"Statement
January 17, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, today issued the following statement regarding the United States’ unfounded duties on Canadian softwood lumber:

“Today, Canada filed a notice of intent to challenge the United States International Trade Commission’s (USITC’s) decision to maintain duties on Canadian softwood lumber products, under Chapter 10 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).

“Canada is disappointed that the United States continues to impose unwarranted and unjust duties on Canadian softwood lumber products. These duties impact our innovative Canadian softwood industry. And with the significant current challenges in housing supply and affordability, these duties also harm U.S. consumers and businesses that need Canadian lumber.

“At every opportunity, we continue to raise the issue of unjustified U.S. duties on Canadian softwood lumber and underline the need to find an acceptable resolution of this dispute that works for our 2 countries and their businesses.

“Canada remains ready and willing to discuss a resolution that provides the stability and predictability the sector needs to ensure its continued growth and success. We will always defend the Canadian softwood lumber industry and the workers and communities it supports.”

Quick facts
The United States conducts sunset reviews of countervailing duty and anti-dumping duty orders on a 5-year cycle.
The purpose of the sunset reviews is to determine whether revocation of the U.S. duty orders would be likely to lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping, subsidization and injury to the U.S. industry. The purpose of the latest sunset review was to determine whether the U.S. would continue applying duties against Canadian softwood lumber products. 
On November 30, 2023, as part of its sunset review process, the USITC voted to maintain duty orders on Canadian softwood lumber, having determined that material injury is likely to recur should the orders be revoked.
The results of the USITC’s sunset review were published in the United States’ Federal Register on December 28, 2023.
Canada’s decision to pursue its sunset review challenge under Chapter 10 of CUSMA was made in consultation with affected provinces, stakeholders and industry leaders.
As part of the sunset review challenge under CUSMA, a binational panel will be established and tasked with determining whether the decision to maintain duties on Canadian softwood lumber products was reached in a manner consistent with U.S. law.",Canada

January 16, 2024 | Ottawa, Ontario | Health Canada

On January 5, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the state of Florida's plan to import select Canadian prescription drugs in bulk.

Since the statement issued by Health Canada last week, the Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health, has spoken to senior U.S. officials to express Canada's disappointment with the FDA decision and to advise that Canada will take all necessary measures to protect the Canadian drug supply.

Minister Holland has been clear that Canada's drug supply is safe and that the Government of Canada has the strong regulatory tools to protect Canada's drug supply.

In a call on January 12 with U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, Minister Holland reiterated the Government of Canada's commitment to protecting domestic drug supply. The Minister received assurances that the U.S. Government has no intention of creating challenges for Canada to access drugs or to trigger drug shortages.

The Minister of Health also spoke to the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, David Cohen, on this matter. The Ambassador expressed his understanding and expectation that the Government of Canada would take action to safeguard the drug supply for Canadians. Ambassador Cohen confirmed that there is no desire or intent of the U.S. Government to create any challenges for Canada on drug access or shortages.

Minister Holland agreed with both Ambassador Cohen and Secretary Becerra to continue to maintain open lines of communication.

""I want to assure Canadians that they will continue to have access to medications they need when they need them. Canada has strong regulations in place to protect supply. Canadians can be confident that our government will continue to take all necessary measures to protect the drug supply in Canada.""

January 12, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence, today issued the following statement:

“Canadian Armed Forces personnel deployed with US Central Command supported the precisely targeted strikes undertaken yesterday by the armed forces of the United States and United Kingdom, as did Australia, Bahrain and the Netherlands, against Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.

“These precision strikes are consistent with the UN Charter and demonstrate the international community’s commitment to defending freedom of navigation and international commerce in the Red Sea.

“Despite multiple strong warnings from the international community, Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have continued, including against U.S. Navy vessels.

“These actions follow the adoption of UNSCR 2722 by the UN Security Council on January 10, 2024, demanding the Houthis end attacks on merchant and commercial vessels. 

“Canada condemns the reckless Houthi attacks against commercial ships and crew operating in the Red Sea. They directly impact the flow of food, fuel, humanitarian assistance and other essential commodities to populations around the world, which can affect the global economy.

“We call on Houthis to cease their attacks immediately, and reiterate that they bear the consequences of their actions. We remain committed to working with our partners in the Middle East to help advance sustainable peace and security in the region.”",Canada
090124,"Statement from Health Canada on FDA decision on Florida bulk drug importation plan
","Statement
January 8, 2024 | Ottawa, Ontario | Health Canada

On January 5, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the state of Florida's plan to import select Canadian prescription drugs in bulk. The Government of Canada is taking all necessary action to safeguard the drug supply and ensure Canadians have access to the prescription drugs they need and has been clear in its position: bulk importation will not provide an effective solution to the problem of high drug prices in the U.S.

Regulations have been implemented under the Food and Drugs Act to prohibit certain drugs intended for the Canadian market from being sold for consumption outside of Canada if that sale could cause, or worsen, a drug shortage in Canada. This includes all drugs that are eligible for bulk importation to the U.S., including those identified in Florida's bulk importation plan, or any other US state's future importation programs.

Health Canada is actively monitoring the Canadian drug supply and continues to ensure that Canadians have access to the drugs that they need. The Department has informed regulated parties of their obligations under Canadian regulations, including the requirement to not distribute a drug to another person for consumption or use outside Canada unless the person holding the licence has reasonable grounds to believe that the distribution will not cause or worsen a shortage of the drug in Canada and has retained detailed records of the information relied upon to make that determination. The Department will not hesitate to take immediate action to address non-compliance, ranging from requesting a plan for corrective measures, issuing a public advisory or other forms of communication, to taking action on the licenses of regulated parties who contravene the export prohibition if warranted.

Health Canada has listened to Canadians and has consulted with industry stakeholders, pharmacists, provinces and territories, patient groups, and medical associations. All agree that the Canadian government must remain focused on ensuring a stable and adequate supply of prescription drugs for Canadians. Health Canada stands ready to take immediate additional action, if needed, to help safeguard the Canadian drug supply.",Canada

January 5, 2024 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, today issued the following statement regarding the United States’ final anti-dumping determination on steel imports from Canada:

“Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a final anti-dumping duty rate of 5.27% on imports of tin mill steel products from Canada.

“Canada is disappointed with this determination. The Canadian steel industry is a reliable partner of U.S. customers and plays a crucial role in the North American supply, manufacturing and delivery systems.

“These duties not only weaken supply chains between Canada and the United States, but also worsen the impacts of inflation on both sides of the border.

“Canada will continue to defend the interests of the Canadian steel industry and its workers.”",Canada
