120725,On the 9th Anniversary of the Philippines-China South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal Ruling,"Nine years ago, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention unanimously ruled China’s expansive South China Sea maritime claims have no basis in international law. This decision, legally binding on both the Philippines and China, was a significant milestone and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes between parties in the South China Sea.

Since the 2016 ruling, China has ignored the decision, continuing to assert unlawful and expansive maritime claims and taking increasingly aggressive actions against its neighbors. Beijing’s expansive claims directly infringe on the sovereign rights and jurisdictions of Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia, and undermine peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific.

The United States supports a free and open Indo-Pacific. We seek to preserve peace and stability, uphold freedom of navigation and overflight, maintain the free flow of trade, and oppose coercion to settle maritime disputes. The United States calls on China to abide by the 2016 arbitral ruling and to cease its dangerous and destabilizing conduct.",USA
110725,Secretary of State Marco Rubio Remarks to the Press,"SECRETARY RUBIO: We had a great visit – great visits. This is an extraordinary forum. ASEAN is the primary way in which the United States engages in Southeast Asia diplomatically. The United States is a country that has deep ties in this region. We are a Pacific nation. We have U.S. citizens that live in the Pacific, obviously in Hawaii and in other territories. And we have strong relationships with many of our partner nation-states here in the region, and that includes, for example, we are the – the United States is the single largest source of foreign direct investment. So we’re very happy to have come here today. We were very warmly received, very positively received. We had very good meetings, some (inaudible) deliverables, and new action items we’ll be able to work on together in the years to come.

QUESTION: Sir, how was your meeting with Wang Yi? How was the progress on that end?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, it was a very productive meeting. It wasn’t a negotiation. It was a meeting. It was a positive meeting. And it’s important that the United States and China have productive meetings and regular engagement and communications. So we felt really good about it – very – thought it was very constructive, and hopefully we’ll be able to build on that to continue to bring stability to our relationship. I think it would benefit the world for that to —

QUESTION: Did you discuss –

QUESTION: And tariffs?

QUESTION: – a summit between President Xi and President Trump?

SECRETARY RUBIO: President Trump’s been invited to visit China. It’s a visit he wants to undertake, and so we’ll work on finding the right date for that, but I’m sure it’ll happen because the President – both presidents want it to happen.

QUESTION: Sir, can you discuss some of the deliverables that were committed to today and yesterday?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, a couple deliverables – obviously, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Malaysia on civil nuclear cooperation, which is very positive. We saw elevation in our relationship with a number of countries that will be formalized over the next few weeks as well. So these are very positive engagements. We had a couple of defense agreements or defense sales that we were able to announce to a couple of our partners during this visit as well. Those will become public soon enough. And so we thought that it was a very positive engagement. And we identified new areas of cooperation.

One of the things we’re very interested in is taking on these scams that are going on, that are preying on, not just Americans, but even people here in many of the countries represented at ASEAN. And we think that these cyber criminals that are operating out there as well that are very harmful and – to our country but to all the countries that are represented here. So, but we hope to have some real deliverables on that, and we look forward to there being a very positive and productive leaders meeting in October.

QUESTION: Sir, a question on tariffs. Are you afraid that the tariffs (inaudible) ASEAN will backfire against the U.S.?

SECRETARY RUBIO: No, I’m not concerned about that. That’s not going to happen, because these tariffs are being applied on a global scale. These are not aimed at one country or one region. It’s all around the world. And it’s very simple, okay? For 20 or 30 years, the United States has built up enormous trade deficits with multiple countries around the world, in every region – in Europe, Canada, Mexico, and in this region as well – and that had to be addressed. And so that’s what the President is doing.

Now, obviously, those tariffs that he’s announced will take affect on the 1st of August, because markets need certainty. But there is always the possibility that before August 1st, or at some point after August 1st, we will reach arrangements with individual countries that changes those numbers in a positive way, but that takes some time to work on. So, that could happen. But by and large, this is not aimed at any one country. This is globalized. This applies to virtually every country in the world, because the trade deficit the U.S. was running with too many countries was simply unsustainable. We had to address it. We had to address it.

QUESTION: Sir, you talked – you met bilateral with all member of ASEAN.

SECRETARY RUBIO: Almost all.

QUESTION: But – yeah, yeah. Okay.

SECRETARY RUBIO: We tried. Yeah. But we saw everybody, and it was a very, very positive engagement. We were very warmly received – a lot of appreciation for the U.S. role, a lot of deep partnerships. Today, by the way, is the 30th anniversary of the U.S. diplomatic relations with Vietnam; that’s something we intend to continue to commemorate with real actions in addition to high-level meetings. So we had a very positive – this was a very, very positive trip.

QUESTION: Sir, can you discuss about – can you say to us what were you discussing with Mr. Lavrov this morning?

SECRETARY RUBIO: With Mr. Lavrov this morning?

QUESTION: Yeah, yes, before the –

SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I’m not going to tell you what I was discussing with him, but it’s not a – unrelated to what we discussed yesterday.

QUESTION: How about aside of tariff, with ASEAN did you (inaudible) with the ASEAN member?

SECRETARY RUBIO: Sure. I mean, there’s a lot of things we have in common. I mean, cyber security is one example of something that I think everyone represented here is very deeply committed to. If you think about the digital economy, which is going to be critical to all the growth that’s going to go on in the world – and most of the growth that’s going to go on in the world is going to happen right here, okay? It’s in Asia, particularly in Southeast Asia; two-thirds of global economic growth is going to happen here over the next 25 or 30 years, and much of that is going to be on digital platforms. Those platforms have to be secure. They have to be secure from cyber criminals. They have to be secure from nation-state actors that may seek to undermine it. So that was a recurring theme in all of our engagements, and everyone is very enthusiastic to work together on these things.

Okay. Thank you. Thank you.",USA
110725,Secretary of State Marco Rubio Remarks to the Traveling Press,"SECRETARY RUBIO:  You guys don’t look nearly as excited to see me as the foreign press briefing.  (Laughter.)  I’m going to spend more time with them.  Which way am I facing, this way?  It’s been – this has been really good.  I mean, we’ve had really great interactions, very positive – everyone’s been very positive and enthusiastic.  Obviously, the issue of trade comes up.  But as I remind everybody, there’s no country in the world that I can meet with right now where the issue of trade and tariffs wouldn’t come up, because this is a global action.

So our negotiators, the baseline will take effect the 1st of August, but obviously, as the President’s made clear, there are opportunities for adjustments based on arrangements that could be made between now and then.  But beyond that, it’s been very positive; all of our engagements here have been very positive.  We’ve been very warmly received, and everyone’s excited we’re here and excited about the opportunities to work together on a number of things.  We’ll have even a few more announcements to make about some elevation of strategic partnerships.  Obviously the Memorandum of Understanding we signed yesterday was very positive with the host country.  They did a great job hosting this, by the way.  This has been a great forum to be able to interact with a lot of different countries, and hopefully to take back some potential decisions that can be made that further strengthen our commitment to this part of the world.

As I pointed out today on two occasions during our interventions and opportunity to speak, the United States is a Pacific nation – not just the mainland of the United States that faces the Pacific, but we have American citizens, and one of our 50 states.  We have – the United States is the number one source of foreign direct investment in Southeast Asia.  We’re not abandoning any of that nor are we abandoning these strong bilateral ties that we have with many of these countries, some of which go back decades and decades.  In fact, today is the 30th anniversary of U.S. diplomatic relations with Vietnam, and think about how far that relationship has come.  We had a very positive meeting today, and with the Vietnamese, as an example, and we’re looking forward to building on – continue to build on that relationship, which is both deeply symbolic given how far our two countries have come, but also we have very exciting opportunities we’re going to be able to work together with them on, and we’re excited to be able to do that. 

So it’s been a great trip, it’s been a great visit.  It’s exceeded all of our expectations. 

QUESTION:  How was —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, how does —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, you met the Chinese – your Chinese counterpart earlier today.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I did.

QUESTION:  The President said just a couple of days ago that he enjoys good relations with China and the Chinese president.  At your meeting, is that the sense you get – that you have good relations with China?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It was a very constructive meeting.  Obviously, look, we’re two big, powerful countries, and there are always going to be issues that we disagree on.  I think there are some areas of potential cooperation.  I thought it was a very constructive, positive meeting, and a lot of work to do.  He’s absolutely right that the President has a very good relationship with President Xi.  It tracks back to his first term.  And obviously there are some issues we’re going to have to work through, and that’s to be expected with countries of our size and scope and influence in the world – two global powers such as the United States and China.  But I thought it was a very constructive and positive meeting and gave us some things we can work on together.

QUESTION:  Do you think they’re going to —

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, what was your message to the foreign minister in the meeting?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Which foreign minister?   I’ve been meeting the foreign minister —

QUESTION:  Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh.  Well, look, it’s very constructive.  I think as I said, the President has a very positive working relationship with President Xi, and obviously the relationship I have with the foreign minister should reflect that.  So we acknowledged there are some issues that are going to be – we have to work through, not just beyond trade but others, but I thought it was a very constructive and positive meeting and gave us a lot to work on.  So that was our message, was the opportunity here to achieve some strategic stability and identify areas where we can cooperate together on and build better communications and working trust.

QUESTION:  What are the odds of a meeting —

QUESTION:  What are some areas of cooperation?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  What? 

QUESTION:  What are some of those areas of cooperation?  The administration hasn’t spelled those out yet, so —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’re going to work through those.  We’re not – we don’t – I don’t have any announcement for you right now.  But it was a very constructive meeting.  I think we left it feeling as though there are some areas we’re going to be able to work together on.  And obviously, as we work through those and we do that in conjunction with the Chinese side, we’ll make public announcements.  The last interaction of our trade representatives was quite positive, and we can build on that and other areas of potential cooperation.

Yeah.

QUESTION:  What are the odds for a meeting or the outlook for a meeting?  We know President Trump has expressed interest in a meeting with President Xi this year, and President Xi has reciprocated with an invitation to China for the President and First Lady.  What’s the outlook or what are the odds of a meeting happening this year after this – after your initial —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, no, the odds are high.  I think both sides want to see it happen.  Obviously we have to build the right atmosphere and the right deliverables so that a visit isn’t just a visit, but it actually has some takeaways from it that are concrete.  But there’s a strong desire on both sides to do it.  The President wants to do it.  The Chinese side wants to see it happen.  President Xi has said that publicly.  So I think the odds are high.  I don’t have a date for  you, but I think it’s coming.  It’ll happen.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, what do you say to those who make the argument that the U.S. tariffs or the threat of those tariffs in the region actually creates an opening for China to be seen as the stable economic partner here?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I don’t agree with that assessment.  I mean, look, at the end of the day the United States has built these tremendous trade imbalances over the last 30 or 40 years.  It’s unfair to America and American workers and American – in addition to threaten our industrial capacity.  Trade needed to be revisited.  The President campaigned on that, and that’s what he’s doing, and he’s resetting it on a global scale. 

At the end of the day, look, I think countries are going to trade with multiple countries.  We don’t view this as an opening for anyone.  We don’t view it that way.  We view it as an opportunity to reset global trade in a way that’s fair for Americans after two or three decades of unfairness.  If you look at some of these trade deficits, they’re massive.  They’re massive.  That has to be addressed, and that’s not sustainable at its current – the current direction that it had gone.  This should have been done a long time ago.  President Trump’s finally done it.  And I think countries understand that.

This was different.  If this was us targeting 10 countries or five countries, then I would understand why countries would be upset.  But the truth of the matter is we’re resetting tariff levels with virtually every country in the world.  And so I understand – if you had a deal where you were running these huge trade deficits with the United States and exporting a lot to the U.S. and built your economy around exports, but had very little import or very little economic activity coming in from the United States, I understand why you don’t want that to change.  But I think most mature leaders – and everybody here is a mature leader – understands that that’s not a sustainable dynamic.  It was one that had to be changed, and that’s what the President’s doing.  So we’re going to be okay. 

QUESTION:  And in discussing trade with these counterparts in the region, did you open the aperture at all and also tell them that this is an opportunity for them to bring into the conversation or the negotiation other elements of the U.S. relationship, whether it be security elements, broader than trade?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that we want to expand on all the other issues, but I think we need to bifurcate the two.  Primarily the trade conversations have been about trade, and that’s how the President’s treated it.  Now, that doesn’t mean that there – the bulk of our meetings here were not about trade.  I’m not the trade negotiator for the United States.  We certainly appreciate the role that trade plays in our bilateral relationships with individual countries.  But the bulk of our talks here have been about all the other things that we cooperate on, whether it’s civil nuclear cooperation, whether it’s respecting international law when it comes to air rights and maritime rights and freedom of navigation and things of this nature, and other opportunities to work together.

So what’s been the bulk of our conversations and it’s been very positively received. 

QUESTION:  To follow up on that, Mr. Secretary, Japan’s prime minister said his country needs to wean itself from U.S. dependence in key areas such as security, as Tokyo faces the prospect of tariffs.  Did you discuss that in your meeting with the Japanese?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, we haven’t.  But at the end of the day, look, I don’t think that that’s a negative comment per se.  We obviously have very strong commitments and an alliance with Japan.  We continue to cooperate very closely with them.  As I speak to you now, there are active exercises going on between the United States and Japan.  So our relationship with them will continue to exist.  The idea that somehow Japan would be able to develop domestic – their own capabilities for mutual self-defense is not – not only is not something that we find offensive, it’s something we’d be supportive of, obviously within the confines of their constitutional system.  But they have some limitations on what they can do.  But the idea that Japan’s military would become more capable is not something we would be offended by; it’s something we would actually be encouraged by.

QUESTION:  So can you talk – you talked about points of possible cooperation with the Chinese.  But on the points, which are well known, of contention, did you get a sense that there was a willingness — 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.

QUESTION:  — of the Chinese to move, or are they just —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I wouldn’t – look, today’s meeting with our Chinese counterparts was not a negotiation on any of these matters.  It is the first time that I met my counterpart in person, who, by the way, happens to also be the national security advisor, so he’s also – he’s not the archivist, though.  (Laughter.)  But I suggested that perhaps he ask for that title and that way we’d be equal.  But —

QUESTION:  That’s a hell of a – that’s a lot bigger job than archivist in the U.S.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, there they have 5,000 years of archives too, so – (laughter) – but I would say that it was a very positive relation, a very positive interaction, and constructive is the most important part.  At the end of the day, no matter what, the United States and China have to have relations.  We have to have communication.  We have to be able to interact with one another.  And it’s just impossible for the foreign ministers of our respective countries to not engage in conversation. 

So I’m glad we had that meeting today.  There’s a lot of work to be done.  No one’s saying it’s easy, but we do have some opportunities on some things we might be able to work on to begin to build some momentum in our relationship.  I thought it was a very good meeting.  I really felt encouraged by it.  But look, there’s work to be done. 

QUESTION:  Secretary, if I can ask a follow-up question.  You mentioned that you see high odds of a meeting between the presidents of the U.S. and China.  There is a big Chinese military parade happening; it’s scheduled for September 3rd.  Did the Chinese foreign minister extend an invitation to that?  Was that discussed as a potential opportunity?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, we didn’t discuss any specific date in mind in that regard.  But the reason why I tell you there’s a high probability they’re going to meet is that they both want to meet, and my – I don’t know President Xi but I know President Trump, and I can tell you that he’s committed to having that meeting happen.  So the reason why I think there’s high odds of it happening is they both want it to happen. 

So I’m sure we’ll work on a date and find a mutually acceptable date for both sides, and I’m pretty confident.  We want it to be a good meeting and we’re going to work hard between now and whatever date that is to make sure that when that visit does happen, it’s as productive as possible. 

QUESTION:  We saw you today seek out the Russian foreign minister in the larger gathering.  Why did you go up and talk to him?  What did you guys discuss?  Did you give him a response from President Trump to the conversation you had yesterday? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, it was just a follow-up on an unrelated item to our conversation yesterday, and I’ll leave it at that. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, many Japanese people are concerning about the U.S. policy, which is demanding drastically increased defense spending.  Do you have something to comment?  How do you think of this? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I wouldn’t characterize it as a demand.  I mean, we’ve encouraged them to invest in certain capabilities.  It’s less to do with the amount of money and more to do about certain things they can do.  At the end of the day we are in an agreement with Japan on collective self-defense, on the ability to come to each other’s aid in a time of conflict or in a time of danger, and there are certain capacities that we think they have high capability.  We understand there are dynamics that – constitutional and legal that limit their ability to invest in certain things versus other things, and – but we have a very close relationship with Japan, very close. 

You may not know this – it’s an inside joke that’s now an outside joke, and I’ll share it with you, and that is that I have – I believe I have met with the foreign minister of Japan more than any other foreign minister on the planet in my five and a half months in office.  I think we’re up to, like, nine or 10 meetings.  We interact, and how we joke with each other is that we see each other more than we see our respective spouses.  And so it’s a very close relationship, a very historic relationship, and one that’s going to continue.

So again, I think anyone who’s looking for, like, drama or division there is – shouldn’t be doing it because the truth of the matter is our relationship with Japan is very solid, and obviously we’re both open, democratic governments.  So when there are some differences of opinion, it’s going to be public, not private – but I don’t see that as a negative.  We have a very strong and very good relationship with Japan, and that’s not going to change. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary – Mr. Secretary, in your conversation with Foreign Minister Wang, did the subject of Taiwan come up too, and in particular the recent military drills being held by the Taiwanese? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No issue about drills.  I think the Chinese position on Taiwan has been expressed.  I don’t think it’s a mystery to anyone in terms of where they stand on it.  And our position has also been expressed pretty openly.  So it was not – as I said, our meeting today was not a negotiation or a back-and-forth on items.  It was more about establishing a constructive baseline where we can continue to talk on multiple fronts, including trade but beyond trade.

QUESTION:  Secretary, if I can ask a question about your meeting with Vietnam, a country with one of the largest trade surpluses with the U.S.  We’ve heard that there was maybe some misunderstanding on – about the agreement announced last week for a 20 percent tariff, that the Vietnamese weren’t confident that that was fully agreed to, that perhaps they were looking for a 10 to 15 percent tariff.  Was that an issue that they raised, trying to lower their tariff level?  Was that – the tariff – an issue that they raised during the bilateral meeting today?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the issue of trade was raised.  We don’t – I’m not – I’m not the negotiator on trade —

QUESTION:  Sure.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — and neither is the foreign minister.  And so we weren’t here to negotiate a trade deal.  And I’ll refer you to our trade negotiators as far as the status of that.  Clearly, Vietnam feels that if they enter into an agreement with the United States, they want to have a tariff rate that’s at least as good as if not better than other countries that don’t have a trade agreement with us.  But I’ll leave – you’ll have to – I have to refer you to our negotiators because I just don’t know what the status of those negotiations are at this point.

QUESTION:  But just to – on that, the President did announce that there was an agreement reached with Vietnam, and yet Vietnam is saying that they never reached that agreement.  So they must have raised this issue with you today. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  I mean, that – neither that issue – it just wasn’t a trade meeting.  We didn’t – I’m not saying it’s not a relevant issue, it’s just not what the purpose of our meeting was about today.  We talked about a lot of other issues.  But perhaps the reason why it wasn’t raised is because I’m not the trade negotiator and these are not trade meetings. 

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, can I follow up on your meeting with Lavrov yesterday?  Have you had a chance to speak to the President about the ideas that were discussed in that meeting?  And what did you discuss with the foreign minister this morning? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Which one?  Lavrov?

QUESTION:  Lavrov, when you spoke to him on —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I went to talk to him about another topic.  It’s not big or mysterious, it’s just another topic.  So it’s – and I’m not going to – we’ll leave it at that.  And as far as – I did speak to the President last night, and – but I have no news to report to you on it right now.  But like I said, I thought yesterday’s meeting – I’m not – I don’t want to oversell it, okay, but it was constructive and there was some things that perhaps we can build on.  Maybe not.  I don’t know.  We’ll find out.  But there are some things that we will potentially explore, and I relayed that to the President and our team here last night.

QUESTION:  The President says that there’s going to be an announcement coming relevant or relating to Russia on Monday. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Mm-hmm.

QUESTION:  Can you tell us a little bit about what his thinking is, based on your conversation last night, where things currently stand?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No.  No.  (Laughter.)  That’s what Monday will be about. 

QUESTION:  Can I follow up on —

QUESTION:  What about he did say that there’s a new agreement between the U.S. and NATO to get new U.S. weaponry through NATO to Ukraine, and NATO is going to fully pay for that, according to the President?  Can you explain to us exactly, number one, how that’s going to work and when those weapons, as part of this agreement, will actually get to Ukraine? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think what you’re referring to is something that Ukraine has already offered, and so has Europe, and that is to buy weapons from the United States and then provide them to Ukraine.  At the end of the day, some of the systems that Ukraine requires are systems that Europe doesn’t make.  They would have to purchase them from the United States. 

In addition to that, I would point to the fact that a number of the defensive weapons that Ukraine seeks are in – our Allies in NATO have them.  So as an example, Germany, I believe, has 13 or 14 Patriot batteries.  Other countries do as well, some others, and some have placed orders for that.  And so we continue to encourage our NATO Allies to provide those weapons, those systems, those defensive systems that Ukraine seeks – that they should provide those weapons to Ukraine since they have them in their stocks, and then we can enter into financial agreements with us where they can purchase the replacements. 

QUESTION:  So these are existing systems?  This is nothing new? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It can be both.  I mean, but at the end of the day, I mean, it’s a lot faster to move something, for example, from Germany to Ukraine than it is to order it from a factory and get it there.  So there are a couple different ways to approach it, but the key is that there are existing capacities within existing U.S. systems within Europe right now that can be transferred to Ukraine, and then the Europeans could purchase the replacements from the United States.  That’s one aspect of what I think the President was referring to yesterday. 

QUESTION:  Just to follow up on the Taiwan issue —

QUESTION:  And that’s why you gave —

QUESTION:  — did Foreign Minister Wang warn you against welcoming President Lai at – through – in a transit visa through the U.S.?  Did he – transit visit through the U.S., did he mention anything about that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, there was not – this was not a warning type meeting. 

QUESTION:  All right.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I mean, obviously we understand their viewpoints on Taiwan.  They’re well stated.  They’ve been stated for many years.  And – but this was not a meeting where any – each – either side warned each other about anything.  This was very constructive and productive, and I hope that that’s how they reflect it as well, because I thought it was a very positive meeting. 

QUESTION:  Any surprises over the last two days? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Surprises? 

QUESTION:  Yeah. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, I don’t think so.  We were very warmly received.  I tell you, I mean, the reception’s been great.

QUESTION:  And that was a surprise?  (Laughter.)

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, I’m just saying that it was a very friendly environment, and I think the reiteration to the point we made, and that is, look, I read these things about how the U.S. is not focused on the Indo-Pacific.  But it’s funny – everywhere I travel in the world, the headline is:  The U.S. is not paying enough attention, whether it’s the Western Hemisphere or NATO or even in the Middle East.  I think sometimes there’s a media dynamic that covers certain parts of the world more than others, but the relationships we have here have existed for a long time – a long time.  When you talk about 6,000 American companies that are directly invested in the economies of Southeast Asia, we’re not walking away from that.  We’re not walking away from that; we’re not walking away from our defense ties that we have in the region; we’re not walking away from the strong economic ties we have in the region.  On the contrary, we want to build on it. 

Just yesterday we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Malaysia on civil nuclear cooperation.  The – I believe as early – either last night or early this morning, our arrangement with – on another civil nuclear program with Thailand came into effect.  So we have a lot of positive things going on and we’re going to continue to build on those.  We’re excited about them and we’re not going to walk away from them.

QUESTION:  Mr. Secretary, while you were in Malaysia, the Trump Administration announced – yeah – a new nomination for – to be ambassador of Malaysia.  Nick Adams, he’s sort of well known on X as a sort of social media personality and does lots of other things.  I was wondering what you could say about this nomination, why Mr. Adams was the right person for this pretty important position in the Indo-Pacific. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, the President makes those nominations.  I support the nomination.  He went through our process of the Presidential Personnel Office, and we look forward to the Senate confirming him so he can get here and be a part of our team. 

QUESTION:  Can I ask a step-back question on trade strategy?  You’ve talked many times now about how decades of trade policy have led to the deindustrialization of the U.S.  And so obviously you and other aides are trying to bring manufacturing or other industrial processes back to the U.S., but you haven’t really given us a vision of what exactly that entails.  I mean, what kinds of jobs are supposed to be coming back to the U.S.?  Howard Lutnick talked about people screwing in tiny things into iPhones, which people mocked after he said that line.  But so what about you?  Like, what vision of industrialization do you see that’s —  

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, there’s certain capacities countries have to be able to have.  For example – I’m just using these as examples – the ability to build a ship.  Right now we go around the world and people say, well, we bought 200 Boeing jets.  Well, Boeing has to be able to make them.  And frankly, we have huge backlogs on that.  So you talk about pharmaceuticals as an example.  Talk about national security – we’ve lost our ability to make pharmaceuticals in the United States and become heavily dependent on the foreign supply chain of the active ingredients that are necessary for pharmaceuticals. 

So I could go on and on, but, I mean, the capability of making things has a national security component to it, not just a jobs component to it.  They’re both important.  So I would look to those as examples of things that the U.S., because of certain decisions that were made by previous policymakers, we’ve seen some of these core industrial capabilities that are necessary not just for economic stability but for national security, leave the United States. 

I would also argue that in addition to our domestic manufacturing capability, I think we and others should be deeply concerned about certain supply chain vulnerabilities and overreliance on one part of the world versus anywhere else.  I don’t think it’s healthy for the United States or for the global economy to be so heavily dependent, as an example, on China or any other country for that matter, where all of the industrial or manufacturing capacity or supplies in the supply chain of a key element is all derived in one place.  So I’m sure you’ve seen the announcement yesterday where the Department of Defense has entered – has taken an equity stake in a company that will be able to process rare earths.  One thing is to have access to raw material; the other thing is to be able to process that raw material into something that’s usable for everything from high technology to anything that has a motor in it.

So I think we at a minimum have to diversify supply chains and secure them.  Some of that will be domestic; others will be in allied nation-states.  But these are the core components of the kinds of things we need to be focused on.  And the – it’s not just the deindustrialization of America.  It’s the loss of these key components and the concentration of those in one or two countries around the world that leave not just us but many countries vulnerable.  That’s just not a sustainable or acceptable situation to find ourselves in.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with China’s Director of the Office of the CCP Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.  Secretary Rubio emphasized the importance of keeping channels of communication open. The discussion was constructive and pragmatic. They agreed to explore areas of potential cooperation, while seeking to manage differences.  The Secretary emphasized the need for continued discussion on a range of bilateral issues.  The Secretary also raised other issues of regional and global importance. ",USA
080725,"Department Press Briefing – July 8, 2025","QUESTION: On – there was this press conference today. The Secretary of Defense and Agriculture were talking about the threat that the Chinese Government poses here in the United States with the strategic acquisition of farmland that’s near military bases. What is the State Department prepared to do to hedge against those kinds of intrusions?

MS BRUCE: Well, the – it’s an interagency kind of decision, and discussions that go on, also negotiations, the nature of a full, whole-of-government dynamic. When you’re dealing with agriculture, you’re dealing with homeland security certainly, and their – the equities that the State Department might hold, I won’t discuss what our actions would be or what the specifics would be. I’m sorry, I have a lot of not-answers for you today, at some point. But I would say that as soon as we have some kind of action, we’ll let you know. But it’s not something I can remark on today.

QUESTION: Can you talk at all about if the sort of – like, writ large, if the department sees this as an ongoing threat as well from the Chinese?

MS BRUCE: Well, I – that would require me to speculate or talk about an opinion framework, which I can’t do certainly at this point. But we’ll have something for you soon.

Yes, ma’am.",USA
260625,"Department Press Briefing – June 26, 2025","QUESTION: Thank you. Sir, I have two questions on China. One is that China reportedly is tracking down its rare-earth experts and seizing their passports. Can you please confirm that? And secondly, as the State Department increases scrutiny on the student visas of foreign students, particularly from China, I’m wondering if the department has concerns about the Chinese student associations in the U.S., given their ties to the Chinese consulates, and they have been described as a tool to extend Chinese influence.

MR PIGOTT: So on your first question, I’ll take that back, see if we can get you some details on that. On the second, on student visas and on our visa policies here in general, what I can say is that every single visa decision is a national security decision, and that’s something that Secretary Rubio takes incredibly seriously. And I think it’s – the American people want that to be taken seriously, the ability to properly vet certain rules, regulations. Every single visa decision is a national security decision no matter who you are applying for a visa. And that’s, like I said, something the Secretary takes very seriously.

So that’s all for today. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

030625,Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the American Compass Fifth Anniversary Gala,"SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Bernie Moreno, how’s the Senate?  (Laughter.)

Thank you guys for having me.  It’s an honor.  I want to thank Chris for the introduction.  Did you get my office?  He just said – I just – the one I used to have, the one in Russell?  Yeah.  Did you find any cash or gold bars?  No.  (Laughter.)

Is there media here?  There’s – (laughter) – that’s what they call – it’s a joke.  It’s a joke.  You guys know.

Thank you, Chris, for that introduction, and actually very proud of the work you did with us on the Small Business Committee, and then Oren and everyone here at American Compass for hosting me here tonight.  A couple observations of seeing someone – we really only got to serve together for, like, 10 days, because I got confirmed pretty quickly.  And by the way, the President was so – and I got 99 out of a hundred votes because the Vice President, at the time his seat had not been filled, and the President for some period of time expressed great concern about the fact that I had 99 votes in the Senate.  He didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.  But I told him recently, sir, you don’t have to worry about that anymore.  I don’t think I’d get 99 votes now.  (Laughter.)

And anyways, but thank you for this chance to speak to you, and by – one more thing I want to tell you about:  I spent – now that I’m in the Executive Branch, we oftentimes have to deal with the fact that we want to do something and it’s like, well, but there’s a statute or there’s a law on the books that limit our ability to do things by executive action.  It requires us to go through certain steps.  And so I increasingly find myself saying who the hell wrote these laws, and in – today I was reminded it was actually me who passed a certain law that stood as an impediment to quick action.  So anyways, yeah, I’ve grown in my appreciation for the Executive Branch more and more each day.  And – but that’s also – the media’s going to say, oh, he’s for an authoritarian form of government.  No, I just – some of these laws I passed are getting in the way of my current life, so we have to work through it.  We will.

But thank you guys for this chance and the work that you’ve done, and I know that obviously you’re going to spend a lot of time focused on domestic decisions, but I want to hopefully pitch you a little bit tonight about what I’ve learned and what I already believed coming into this job, that so much about what happens domestically, economically is increasingly intertwined in geopolitics.  It always has been.  I think that’s one of the lessons we forgot, but I think we’ve been reminded of that here, most recently in a number of events that brought that to bear.

The first thing I would say is I think it’s always been true – one of the amazing things, one of the reasons why history repeats itself – people like to say that – is because human nature does not change.  Technologies change, the clothes we wear change, even languages change, governments change.  A lot of things change, but the one thing that is unchanged is human nature.  It’s the same today as it was 5,000 years ago, and that’s one of the reasons why history often repeats itself.

And one of the things about human nature – I’m not trying to sound like a psychologist here, but one of the things that I think history proves is that one of the things we are programmed as people with is the desire to belong.  In fact, if you notice, one of the – if you put humans anywhere, a handful of people anywhere, one of the first things they start doing is trying to create things that they can join or be a part of, and that’s true for nationhood and nation-states, the concept of nationhood.

Now, it’s a new concept.  I mean, before we all – but we had something.  It was like organizations, whether it was city-states or tribal organizations, but the advent of the nation-state is a normal evolution of human behavior because people think it’s important to belong to something, and being part of a nation is important.  And I think that’s really true, obviously, increasingly in how geopolitical decisions are made.

I think that’s obvious and people understand that, but it’s one of the things that we forgot.  And we certainly forgot it at the end of the Cold War.  If I can take you back to the end of the Cold War – and understand for me these were formative years, because I grew up in the ’80s, the greatest – probably the greatest decade ever, confirmed by the – yeah.  (Applause.) 

You know why I know this?  Because my kids – I have young – young – I say “young” and they’re, like, 24, 22, 20 – just turned 20 – and one who’s 17.  Every – all they do is watch reruns from the ’80s and ’90s.  They don’t make good TV anymore.  Everybody wants to watch stuff from the ’80s and ’90s, so that’s just my pitch.  The ’70s were a dark period of time because of disco music, but – and the ’80s just – got a disco fan back there.  But the ’80s, we did – the hair was a little too big, but other than that.

But going back, the ’80s, you grew up, and I remember in 1983 – now I’m aging – I just turned 54.  I feel 55, but I – and it must be 1983.  Do you guys remember a movie called the – oh, gosh, what was it?  It was about nuclear war.  Do you remember this?  It was 19 – no, War Games, that was a great movie.  I’m talking about one that was on TV that scared the hell out of me.  There was –

AUDIENCE:  The Day After.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  The Day After.  Do you remember that movie, The Day After?  This was traumatizing, and they had this thing on television.  But basically grew up understanding that the world at any moment could end because the United States and the Soviet Union were headed for conflict and war and that maybe we wouldn’t even make it to 25 and things of this nature.

I forgot about War Games.  War Games was another good movie, where this guy hacks into the computer.  This was an ’80s hacker.  This was not – I can remember the phone and the modem, and it was – what was that actor?  It was the same – Matthew Broderick.  It’s a great movie.  I know I’m completely off topic – (laughter) – but let me just tell you I lived in Las Vegas at the time, and if you recall, the first city that he blows up in the war games is Las Vegas.  And I was sitting in the audience and everybody was like chuckling – nothing funny about this Las Vegas strike.  (Laughter.)

In any event, so this is what we grew up in.  And then in 1989, in 1990 and ’91, it was my first years in college, and literally the entire world just transformed before my very eyes.  Understand you grew up your whole life, and like the whole world is about the Soviet Union, and all of a sudden the Soviet Union no longer exists.  My favorite memory of that is that I was actually taking a course that fall by a Soviet expert at – I think it was in Gainesville, Florida.  And this poor guy’s entire career came crumbling down over a three-month period as the Soviet Union collapsed.  It was like all these years of work, you have a PhD in Soviet studies, and now the Soviet doesn’t exist anymore.  So I don’t know what he did after that.  I need to check up on that guy.

But anyways, the point is the whole world transformed and there was this effusive exuberance, the belief that the Cold War is over, we won, and now the entire world is going to become just like us – free enterprise democracies.  That was a very idealistic thing to believe.

But here’s the other conclusion they made, and that is that everybody – that it didn’t – nationhood no longer mattered when it came to economics, that right now the world would no longer have borders.  It wouldn’t matter where things were made.  What mattered is they were made in the most efficient place.

And it became mantra.  And look, I think it became part of Republican orthodoxy for a very long time, an orthodoxy that I came up in, which was it’s okay if productive capacity moves to another country, because what that will do is it will free up our workers to do work that’s even more productive and pays them more.  It was the famous or the infamous idea that who cares that you lost your job at a factory, you’re going to learn how to code, and then you’re going to be – you’re going to make a lot more money doing that.

Well, it was completely unrealistic, number one, and became incredibly disruptive that that decision was made.  But here’s the other implication of it:  It robbed a nation of its industrial capacity, of its ability to make things.  And its industrial capacity and its ability to make things has two ramifications:  The first is it hurts your economy, it hurts your country, it robs people of jobs, and the transition is not nearly as easy, but it also ends up becoming corrosive and destructive to communities.  I mean, as a result we had a rust belt.  We had places that were gutted and we had families that for generations that worked in a certain field or for a certain company, and all of a sudden that company or that field vanished because it moved somewhere else where it was cheaper to do.  And those jobs were gone, and obviously it became incredibly destructive – not just for the United States, by the way, but for many nations in the industrialized West.

But the other thing it robbed us of is the ability to make things, which is a national security impediment – impairment – and a very significant one.  If you go back to the World War – World War II, the admiral who had been tasked with planning Pearl Harbor thought it was a really bad idea.  He went through and obviously followed orders, but he thought it was a very bad idea because he had spent a substantial amount of time studying in the United States when he was younger.  And his conclusion was that attacking the United States was a bad idea because even though at the time militarily we were behind the Japanese, certainly technologically and otherwise, we had factories and we had access to raw material and resources.  And he knew that over time, once those factories and those raw materials were put to the war machine, the Japanese would not be able to keep up.

And you could very well argue that the end of World War II, that the victory in World War II both in Europe and especially in Asia, was the result of America’s industrial capacity.  When the Japanese lost a plane, they lost a plane.  When we lost a plane – and their planes were better than ours for a long time.  When we lost a plane, we were able to produce hundreds to replace it.  Industrial capacity mattered in terms of national security, and that’s never changed.  That’s always been true. 

And so today, what you find is because of all of those years of neglect, because of the loss of industrial capacity, we didn’t just undermine our society, we didn’t just undermine our domestic economy, we’ve undermined our position in the world.  And what you will find and what we find even now is that increasingly, on geopolitical issue after geopolitical issue, it is access to raw material and industrial capacity that is at the core both of the decisions that we’re making and the areas that we’re prioritizing. 

It’s – now, the technologies are different, but nonetheless that is what we’re increasingly prioritizing.  And that’s become really apparent to me.  I think it was even going into this job, but in the months that I’ve been there, on place after place, every country in the world is now pitching themselves as a source of rare earth minerals.  Every country in the world – by the way, they’re not that rare, so every country has access to it, but it’s become a big – but that alone is not enough because you have to have access to rare earth minerals, but then you have to have the ability to process them and you have to have – to make them into usable material. 

And frankly, what the Chinese have done over the last 25 or 30 years is they’ve cornered the market.  And this is one of the true challenges to sort of pure free-enterprise view of these things.  You cannot compete with a nation-state who has decided they’re not interested in making money.  They don’t – they’re not interested in making money in this field.  They are interested in the short term in dominating the market, being the sole-source provider for the world of a certain product.  Because once you establish industry dominance in any one of these fields, you can charge the world whatever you want. 

Now, one thing is if we said:  Well, this happened because they’re just better than us.  But that’s not why it happened.  It happened because we literally gave it away.  Because we made the decision, we made the policy decision, that it was okay, we were okay with 80-something percent of the active ingredients in most of our generic pharmaceuticals coming from another country.  We were okay with giving that away.  We were okay with giving away all kinds of things like that.  And now, now we are in a crunch.  And I say “we.”  I mean the rest of the world is in a crunch, because we have realized that our industrial capability is deeply dependent on a number of potential adversary nation-states, including China, who can hold it over our head. 

And so in many ways the nature of geopolitics is now adjusted to that and is adjusting to that.  And it’ll be one of the great challenges of the new century and one of the priorities of this administration under President Trump is to reorient our domestic and the way we pursue geopolitics to take into account for the fact that you can never be secure as a nation unless you’re able to feed your people, and unless you’re able to make the things that your economy needs in order to function and ultimately to defend yourself. 

There is virtually none of the leading-edge industries of the 21st century in which we don’t have some level of vulnerability, and it’s become one of the highest geopolitical priorities that we now face – not simply access to raw material but figuring out how can we have more industrial capacities in these critical fields, ideally domestically, but if not here then diversify the global supply chain so that it cannot be used against us as a point of leverage at a time of potential conflict. 

In fact, unless we fix it, some of these conflicts will never happen because we will never be able to enter – the amount of leverage they will have on us will begin to constrain our ability to make foreign policy.  Unable to get into a tremendous amount of detail, let me just say that even as I speak to you now, there are a number of foreign policy issues in which we’re having to balance what we would ideally want to do with what we may not be able to do in the short term until we fix these problems.  This is a real challenge in American geopolitics, and it’s one that’s become a priority and goes right to the heart of the decisions that were made over the last 20 or 30 years that were – that were a mistake and that we’re now trying to correct.

The other, which is more broad but I think also ties to economic policy, is the following:  Part of the decisions that were made were, in the end, if something is good for the global economy, that’s really what matters.  Ultimately, a lot of public policy decisions were made without the nation-state in mind.  Rather, the decision was:  Is this good for the global economy?  Is this good for global economic growth?  Is this good for prosperity in other places even if it may not be in our interest? 

And we made those decisions even during the Cold War to some extent.  We allowed nations to treat us unfairly in trade, but we allowed them to do it because we didn’t want those countries to become victim to a communist revolution that would overthrow them.  But then we kept it going.  And so today there are multiple countries around the world that are fully developed economies, but whom we have enormous trade imbalances because they want to continue that system moving along.  And that has to be corrected.

But here’s the final point, and here’s why this is also critical.  Because not only did we take out nation-state interest and the national interest out of our economic policies; we also took it out of the way we made foreign policy decisions.  The idea that our foreign policy, depending on the place and on the issue, should be centered and focused primarily on what is good for the United States was completely lost.  Time and again, we made decisions in foreign policy because of what was good for the international order or what was good for the world.  And I’m not saying those things are irrelevant, but the number one priority of our foreign policy must – of the United States – the number one foreign policy priority of the United States needs to be the United States and what’s in the best interest of the United States.  (Applause.)

That’s not isolationism.  That’s common sense.  On the contrary, in order to do that, we have to engage in the world.  But we need to engage in the world in a way that prioritizes our national interest above all else.  And the reason why we do that goes back to my point at the outset of this, with human nature.  And that is:  That’s what other countries do all the time.  Virtually every single nation-state we interact with prioritizes their national interest in their interactions with us.  And we need to begin to do that again, and we’re beginning to do that again – prioritizing the national interest of the United States above everything else in making these foreign policy decisions.

And I’ll close by saying that’s where foreign policy works best.  As I’ve said to multiple foreign leaders, including some with whom we haven’t had engagements with for many years, I said the way foreign policy works best is when our national interests are aligned.  When they’re aligned, that’s where we have incredible opportunity for partnership together.  And when they’re not aligned, that’s where I expect them to pursue their national interest and us to pursue ours, and to do so peacefully if possible, and that’s the work of diplomacy. 

And so I think the work you have done to reorient our thinking towards the national interest – both in our domestic economic policies as well as in our foreign policies – is critical work for 21st century conservatism.  And I thank you for all the work you’ve provided.  You’ve done great work.  When no one else was talking about these things, when no one else was providing the material that allowed us to build public policy and challenge thinking, you were doing it.  And I encourage you to continue to do it because this is going to be the work of a generation.  It’s – there’s still much work to be done.  We are in the midst of an important and long-overdue realignment in our thinking in American politics, and it takes organizations like American Compass to drive the innovation and the thinking.  And we appreciate everything you’ve done up to this point and encourage you to continue to do that.

And one of the people who has really been a leader in this regard – someone who I actually got to know as part of this project and this thinking back when he was only a best-selling author and not even a political figure yet – is our current Vice President, who is doing a phenomenal job, and someone I’ve grown tremendous – my admiration for him has grown tremendously.  I admired him before.  I admired him in the Senate.  I admire him a lot more now as Vice President because I think vice presidents are just more impressive than senators, Bernie.  That’s all.  (Laughter.)  But I can say that now that I got 99 votes, see, because I don’t need their votes anymore.  (Laughter.)

But the Vice President is going a phenomenal job, and I think is one of the most powerful and clearest voices in the world – really at the edge, at the leading edge of this new thinking in American politics.  And it’s my honor to serve with him in this administration, and it’s my honor to invite him onto the stage now to speak to all of you.

So thank you for the opportunity to be here.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice President of the United States, JD Vance.  (Applause.)",USA
030625,On the 36th Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre,"In the spring of 1989, tens of thousands of students gathered in Beijing’s largest public square to mourn the passing of a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader who tried to steer China toward a more open and democratic system. Their actions inspired a national movement. Hundreds of thousands of ordinary people in the capital and throughout China took to the streets for weeks to exercise their freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly by advocating for democracy, human rights, and an end to rampant corruption. The CCP responded with a brutal crackdown, sending the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to open fire in an attempt to extinguish the pro-democracy sentiments of unarmed civilians gathered on Beijing’s streets and in Tiananmen Square.

The CCP actively tries to censor the facts, but the world will never forget. Today we commemorate the bravery of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989. Their courage in the face of certain danger reminds us that the principles of freedom, democracy, and self-rule are not just American principles. They are human principles the CCP cannot erase.",USA

MS BRUCE: Hi, everybody. I intended to come out a little bit early, anticipating our friend Karoline closing.

MR PIGOTT: Excuse me.

MS BRUCE: Hi, Tommy.

MR PIGOTT: I just wanted to make sure your badge is – I apologize.

MS BRUCE: Oh, my badge. It’s like I’ll never be able to function without my badge from this point forward. Thank you, sir. Thank you.

All right. I feel so unofficial now. Alrighty.

Yes, so our friend Karoline briefed today, which was terrific, and so here we are. Thank you, everybody. For everyone watching at home, welcome aboard. I appreciate it. We know that many streaming options – we know CSPAN carries this live as well, and it’s great to see all of you here.

Do have a couple of announcements here right at the top. Today, the State Department notified Congress on our reorganization plan to build an America First State Department capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. The Secretary issued a statement on the notification. As he said: “Over the past quarter century, the domestic operations of the State Department have grown exponentially, resulting in more bureaucracy, higher costs, and fewer results for the American people. Since my first day as Secretary, I have said that this department must move at the speed of relevancy, and in April announced a broad reorganization of the department to better achieve that goal. Today, we took the next step in that process by notifying Congress of how we plan to do that.”

Further, he said: “The plan submitted to Congress was the result of thoughtful and deliberative work by senior department leadership. We have taken into account feedback from lawmakers, bureaus, and long-serving employees. The reorganization plan will result in a more agile department, better equipped to promote America’s interests and keep Americans safe across the world.”

In addition, over the last few days Secretary Rubio has announced new visa policies that put America first. I’m sure none of you have any questions about those. (Laughter.) The State Department is determined to protect Americans’ right to free speech and to counter the malign influence and actions of the Chinese Communist Party.

The bottom line: We are using and will continue to use every tool in our tool chest to make sure that we know who it is who wants to come into this country and if they should be allowed to come in. Every sovereign nation has a right to secure its borders and to make sure they know who is in their nation and if they are safe to be here.

And finally, Secretary Rubio met with the North Macedonian minister of foreign affairs today and his delegation. I had the pleasure of being at that meeting as well. The meeting underscored the strong relationship between the United States and North Macedonia, and highlighted mutual interests in regional stability, economic cooperation, and NATO. They explored opportunities to expand the economic collaboration, which would include energy, trade, and investment.

A fabulous delegation; it was a pleasure to meet them. And now it’s a pleasure to see you guys again, even though I’ve met most of you, maybe not all of you, taking your questions. Shall – Matt?

QUESTION: Yes, please.

MS BRUCE: Do you want – I know you’ve got a few things on your mind.

QUESTION: Yeah. Well, yes. So I assume you were being sarcastic when you said that I know none of you have questions about the visa policy.

MS BRUCE: Of course. Yes, sarcasm is my – is my favorite thing.

QUESTION: Yes. So anyway, I do have a couple questions, but I’ll keep them brief.

MS BRUCE: Sure.

QUESTION: On the visa policy, specifically as it relates to China and the Chinese students, the statement that came out last night was – it wasn’t very specific, shall we say, about what affiliations with the Chinese Communist Party and what critical areas of study would the applicants for visas under those would be – would be subjected to more scrutiny. So I’m wondering if there is an answer to what is the actual Chinese Communist Party affiliation that would make you ineligible for a visa, or what is the – what is – what are examples of the critical areas in which – will be subject to —

MS BRUCE: Well, since starting here at the State Department in January, I have been impressed with a number of things – most everything. But also learning about the nature of the visas – and I’ve said here regularly, as many people watching around the world might not know – is that we don’t give details about what our methods are regarding visas. Of course, everyone is vetted. I think if you’ve gone through the process, it’s about filing for a visa, and then you have to have a meeting. And you do it in your home country, your consulate, your embassy, and that’s the process. So there is a vetting; there always has been.

What we don’t discuss – again, because of privacy issues, but also because it’s different for each person – that there are a series of dynamics that can be applied, questions that can be asked, issues looked at, and we use every tool that we have to vet and to make sure we know who’s coming in.

In this particular case, the United States is putting America first by beginning to revoke visas of Chinese students as warranted, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party – as you mentioned, Matt – or studying in critical fields, and enhancing scrutiny of visas for all Chinese nationals, including Hong Kong passport holders.

I will not be getting into the details not only of what the details are regarding the scrutiny and the methods regarding the visa itself, but also when it comes to critical fields. I was rather pleased, having seen very often announcements that don’t really give any information – and there’s reasons for that; for national security, because there’s negotiations, it’s diplomatic, et cetera – or giving away the nature of how we choose to do things might give up our hand and make certain things less effective.

In this case, when we think of critical fields, which is obviously a very specific phrase, we think about national security, the nature of how we keep America safe and secure and more prosperous. And it is important to have, I think, a broad base because that could mean something different to many people. It could mean many things, and this is going to be up to the people making the decisions. And I think that that’s in the framework of what we’ve discussed regarding the visa actions as well when it comes to keeping America safe.

The United States, I further can say here, will not tolerate the CCP’s exploitation of U.S. universities or theft of U.S. research, intellectual property, or technologies to grow its military power, conduct intelligence collection, or repress voices of opposition. The Trump Administration is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding our national security and public safety through our visa process, obviously very openly and transparently applied by Secretary Marco Rubio.

Every visa adjudication is a national security decision – every single one of them. Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home. So we’ve experienced this through these last several weeks. It is something that is at the heart and at really at the front line of protecting the country, and we’re taking it seriously and we’re being open about the nature of what’s happening in this particular instance.

QUESTION: Okay. So could I just ask, that last bit that you just said, which was not in the statement last night and is a little bit more specific about —

MS BRUCE: Oh yeah, about the nature of the theft of certain things.

QUESTION: Just that last – yes, the last bit.

MS BRUCE: Well, we – again, as reporters here all and curious people, you know the nature of what China has been doing about – with technology, right; stealing information, intellectual property, U.S. research, copyrights, et cetera. It’s – this is not new or confusing, and this is one way that we certainly can try to mitigate that issue.

QUESTION: Thank you.

MS BRUCE: Yes, Andrea Mitchell.

QUESTION: Tammy, let me – I wanted to follow-up on that, and then I’m going to ask you about Hamas and Gaza and Israel.

MS BRUCE: Of course. Certainly.

QUESTION: Is there any re-evaluation of TikTok and its vulnerabilities, as was defined by the previous administration as dangerous for national security reasons? Does the White House or – well, does the administration have any re-evaluation of TikTok in this context as you’re cracking down on Chinese intelligence gathering?

MS BRUCE: I would say you’d have to send that question – ask that at the White House. What we do know though, of course, is that we’re serious about Chinese intervention here, if you will, and the nature of what’s driving, of course, this new visa vetting dynamic. But for that specifically, I know the President has spoke on it. You’ll need to ask the White House.

QUESTION: And then I ask you about the —

MS BRUCE: Yes.

QUESTION: — possibility of a tentative acceptance by Israel of a ceasefire.

MS BRUCE: Could we – let me come back to you on that. I think many of you also have the visa questions, correct? Are we dealing —

QUESTION: Right.

MS BRUCE: Let’s stick with visas because there’s many different issues at hand, not just this one regarding China.

So Daphne.

QUESTION: The European issue as well?

MS BRUCE: Yeah, we’ll get to Gaza after that. Yes.

QUESTION: Thank you. There are hundreds of thousands of Chinese students currently in the U.S. What proportion does the State Department expect will face visa revocations?

MS BRUCE: Oh, I can’t answer that at all. I mean, one of the things we also – even if I was inclined to want to answer, is we’re not going to speculate on where this would go. A lot of this clearly is – perhaps has not been done before as we look at this dynamic and make a determination of exactly what’s been happening in this country. A great deal of what President Trump has done and what Secretary Rubio is doing is beginning to look at certain things, whether it’s foreign aid, the nature of visas, how people are getting here, what’s happening at the universities, the things we’ve seen that we don’t like that have emerged from them.

But I certainly would not hazard to suggest that the numbers matter. What the story is here is that the issue of being serious about safety for the country matters, and we’re going to look at that at every single front. So I think it’s less about numbers and more about the fact that we’re keeping America safe and taking the actions that we need to do to do that.

QUESTION: At the tail end of Trump’s first administration, the U.S. revoked visas for more than a thousand Chinese students and researchers that were deemed security risks. Should we expect the actions that Secretary Rubio announced yesterday to exceed those first-term measures?

MS BRUCE: Gosh, you love the numbers. She loves the numbers. Daphne from Reuters.

How many originally did you say Chinese students were here?

QUESTION: Hundreds of thousands.

MS BRUCE: Hundreds of thousands. And so you’ve provided a number of about a thousand, which I’m not quite sure how that number even would have been a number that you could rely on because Consular Affairs does not provide numbers. We don’t discuss visas that are issued, visas that are removed, things that are revoked. Those are numbers that are not shared, are not provided, and I would suggest using caution if someone is giving you a number like that.

Again, I have no idea what the numbers will be. What I do know is that the people who are deemed to be a threat to the country or a problem now will be vetted again or looked at seriously, and Americans will be safer. That’s the story here.

QUESTION: And then just on the visa restriction policy announced yesterday over the censoring of Americans, can you provide any specific examples of what actions prompted the U.S. to institute this policy? And when might we expect any visa restrictions to be implemented?

MS BRUCE: In a case like this, you’re looking at a policy that is a reflection of what the Trump Administration and the American people care about, which is the idea of Americans being censored. We experienced this through COVID, the nature of our ability to be able to speak our minds. And while I won’t give you – or can give you or would give you specifics about how this would – this particular restriction would be approached, which is not done in a blanket way – right? – that there is individuals who are flagged or who are seen as being a participant in some aspect of the censorship of Americans, what I can say is that all of what you see emanating from the Trump Administration and the State Department is a reflection of the policy of this administration and what the American people want and expect when it comes to what their futures are going to hold.

QUESTION: On the same?

MS BRUCE: Again, on visas?

QUESTION: Yes.

MS BRUCE: Hold on please.

QUESTION: A different one?

QUESTION: Still on visas.

MS BRUCE: Still on visas. One moment. I’ll be back with you.

QUESTION: Thank you.

MS BRUCE: Yes.

QUESTION: One, on the cable that went out on Tuesday, it said they expected this expanded social media vetting guidance for visa applicants to go out in the coming days. Are you still tracking that timeline?

MS BRUCE: Yes.

QUESTION: And can you give us any guidance on what that is going to look like?

MS BRUCE: Yes. I can’t give you a specific timeline, but there will be more information. What I can say is that, in general, if – because that was an internal communication that was leaked. At the same time, we have confirmed that it’s – the details are accurate. Also, the Trump Administration is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through the visa process specifically. Every adjudication, as I noted to you, is a national security decision.

And a visa, as a reminder, is not a privilege – it’s a privilege; it’s not a right. It’s not a birthright. It’s not something that you’re owed, no matter where you come from. Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. And this is important with these conversations because it seems like only certain groups are facing vetting with visas. Every single person does. So I would say that, yes, you’re going to get more information. And this is, as a result, not an interminable kind of end – there is an endpoint, and it should be rather quick, as consulates and embassies make adjustments when it comes to how they handle visas.

QUESTION: Can we expect the appointments to open back up immediately after that guidance goes out to posts?

MS BRUCE: Well, one thing I can tell you – a few things I can say is people can still make their application, do their regular steps, but it’s a two-step process, right. You apply and then you have to get an appointment to meet with people to talk with them. Unlike – I don’t know – unlike – often with the passports – I mean, there’s a very specific process. So right now, there might be some delay. And what I’m told to encourage people to do is to regularly check to see when those spaces open. So as opposed to – let me just say, I would not be recommending that if this was going to be weeks or months. So if you’re – if you’ve applied for a visa, and you want to, please do. Then if there’s no – if you’re not getting an appointment, just – there’s an online system. You continually recheck to see when those spots might open. I can’t tell you immediately after some indetermined moment of an action, but I can tell you that it’s something that would happen perhaps sooner than later.

QUESTION: And then one more. On Harvard, my understanding is you are now reviewing all of the visas of Harvard-affiliated visa holders, not just students. Can you confirm that? And why is this broader review taking place? Do you expect it to impact medical professionals, for example, professors at the university?

MS BRUCE: I – again, I hesitate only because all of this is regarding visas and the nature of our mission and the approach that we take regarding who is being scrutinized and how we’re going to approach. So I’m – we’re going to put that off. I think we probably will have a bit more on that next week perhaps, but we’ll put that off now. But what I can say clearly, with all of the news over the last 48 hours, is that the visa process is a key component of keeping the country safe. It is not targeted at certain only specific individuals. This is an overarching national security action, and we are acting quickly. Obviously, we’re a nation that loves people coming here the legal way, and we want to help facilitate that but not at our own risk.

Shaun.

QUESTION: Sure. More on the visas. If I – if you don’t mind me emphasizing, as Daphne and Matt asked you on the language. The Secretary’s statement yesterday –
“aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections” – it’s not specific. He’s not saying specifically those with connections. So, I mean, there are 277,000 Chinese students in the United States. I mean, should all of them feel that they’re at some risk of having their visas revoked?

MS BRUCE: I think everyone who’s here on a visa has to recognize – certainly as what they’ve seen over the last few months – that America takes their visas seriously, that vetting is not a one-time process – it’s continuing – and that when things – if things happen, if you get arrested, if there is some kind of an issue, it – you’re – it’s probably going to be seen at some point. But I do think that with this particular dynamic, it’s clear that there is an interest in making sure that those who are here from China on a visa understand that we are taking our national security seriously and we are looking at their visas. And if everything is fine, terrific. But that will be a vetting that certainly continues and is important, clearly, to the administration.

QUESTION: Okay. And a bit broader. I mean, you said if everything is fine, you’re welcome. More broadly, all these things that are going on with the student visas, with the vetting, with the suspension for now of new appointments – I mean, is it still a priority for the administration to encourage students to come to the United States? They have other options. It’s been said that Hong Kong, for example, is now saying students at Harvard – doctoral students – have a fast-track over there.

MS BRUCE: Sure. Yeah.

QUESTION: Is there any concern that the U.S. is losing a competition? After all, there’s $50 billion into the economy of – from international students.

MS BRUCE: Yeah, well, people come here because this is where you start new lives, where you have every opportunity in the world. There’s a reason why people come here. It’s because of what the country represents, yes, the excellence of our schools. And we want to keep it that way. We want parents who send their children – whether they be from a different country or America – to an American university that they can recognize their child when that child returns home, and that child actually has skills and an education that can improve their future, that can get them a job, that can help facilitate the dreams that they’ve had, as opposed to political indoctrination or the idea of just activism or a certain political framework that they move out with.

This should be an education that is literally liberal – the idea that you learn things that help facilitate your life no matter where you come from, who you are, if you’re a Jew or a non-believer, or an atheist, or black, or white, or a woman. We’ve been through this in this country for the last two to three generations still, and our focus is making sure that everyone who does want to send their child to a school in this country can do so knowing that they’re going to be safe, they’re going to be able to get into a building and not held hostage in a library because it’s been occupied, or that they’re going to be able to actually learn things that you’re paying that kind of money for. So yes, it not only should encourage more people, for those who are already here, it’s certainly an important dynamic for believing and understanding that your child’s going to be safe and that you’re going to get something that you’ve paid for more than a social activist who lives in your basement.",USA
280525,"New Visa Policies Put America First, Not China","Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.

210525,"Secretary of State Marco Rubio Before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on the FY26 Department of State Budget Request
","SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.  I’ll try to stay under the five minutes and – so we can get time for questions here.

So when I took this job – and I said this during my confirmation hearing – the most important thing we need to do is return American foreign policy to be centered on our national interests.  For far too long, that had been lost as a concept of foreign policy.  In essence, in many cases, oftentimes the U.S. engaged in the world on the basis of what was good for the global order or the international community and what like.  And look, for about 30 years, that made a lot of sense – until the end of the post-Cold War era.

(Protest utterances.)

So that made a lot of sense for a long period of time during the Cold War.  But then we entered the post-Cold War era, and the war – and the world order has rapidly changed.  We entered a new era about 12 or 14 years ago when we entered an era of near-peer competition, where, for the first time since the end of the Cold War, the United States had a near-peer competitor and adversary in the state of China.  And we need to confront that, and our foreign policy needs to be geared around that and all the realities of this new world.

And so what that means is we have to have a State Department that can deliver on a foreign policy that is rooted in the national interests of the United States.  To defend the national interests of the United States requires us, number one, to make sure that every dollar we spend and every action we take has to have measurable outcomes that deliver for the American people.  They have to either make our country safer or they have to make our country stronger or they have to help make our country more prosperous.  It has to do at least one of those three things, and ideally, whether it’s a program or a measure that we take, it should do all three of them.

Now, that – what that means is that there are some great causes in the world.  There really are.  There are some great causes.  There are some horrifying things that are happening on the planet.  America cannot solve every single one of them.  What we need to focus on is prioritizing our foreign policy to those areas that are in our national interests.

Now, we will still remain the largest contributor of foreign aid and humanitarian assistance on this planet, by far.  The United States, even under the budget that’s before you today and the changes we have made, will still contribute more in foreign aid than the next 10 countries combined, than the entire OECD or the next closest country.  It’s not China.  It’s Germany, and it’s way behind us even now.  But that foreign aid has to be geared towards our foreign – to our national interests.  We need to design a State Department that delivers on that.

Yes, we canceled a bunch of contracts in USAID.  Some were stupid and outrageous.  Others didn’t serve the national interest.  And others we kept.  And we are folding it under the Department of State.  And you know why?  Because we want it to be part of the toolbox of foreign policy, not a standalone.  It is not charity.  Foreign aid is not charity.  It is designed to further the national interests of the United States",USA
200525,Secretary of State Marco Rubio Before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on the FY26 Department of State Budget Request ,"SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  It’s an honor to be here on behalf of the National Archives and in addition to —

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Yeah.  We don’t have time for you to list —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Okay.  Well, we’ll focus on State today.  (Laughter.)

I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.  When I came here four months ago, I told you that what I wanted was a State Department that was at the heart and soul of American foreign policy, that it was the single biggest driver both of action but also of ideas, and we’re well on our way to achieving that.  And the way we’ve – I’ll talk about some of the individual things we’ve accomplished during that time, but first, let me explain sort of some of the processes by which we seek to arrive at it.

The first is a reorganization of the way the State Department functions, and we have sort of previewed that with the committee and many of the individual members.  Obviously, we’ll have to come – we’ve taken input and are taking input now through the notice process, and then we’ll come back to you with a formal congressional notification once – but we are taking a lot of the input, both provided by individual members and your staff but also from inside the building.

But if I could simplify, the goal is this, and that is –

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Yeah.  All right.  First —

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Carry on.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  The goal is to drive power and action in our agency to the regional bureaus and to our embassies.  On everything we do, we want our foreign policy to be holistic.  So, for example, we recognize that the set of factors both in diplomacy and foreign aid in Guatemala or in Trinidad or in Jamaica are going to look different than they may somewhere in Africa, somewhere in the Indo-Pacific region.  And we want those decisions, and the influence over those decisions to be made, to be driven to the regional bureaus.  And so what we’ve done is we’ve taken a lot of the functional bureaus and functional processes and moved them under the purview of the regional bureaus and the career individuals that serve there and ultimately down to the embassy.

One of our first tests, Senator Shaheen, is going to be in Syria.  We don’t have an embassy in Syria.  It’s operating out of Türkiye.  But we need to help them.  We want to help that government succeed because the alternative is full-scale civil war and chaos, which would of course destabilize the entire region.  And we are going to allow our people on the ground – both our embassy personnel at the Damascus embassy located in Türkiye and, for the short period of time, at least during the interim, our ambassador in Türkiye – to work with local officials there to make determinations about what kind of aid they need.  Is it humanitarian?  Is it improving law enforcement or governance functions?  We think it’s going to be the first test of this new model, but I strongly believe that our decisions and the power to drive decisions and the decisions and the inputs that we’re taking have to be driven in many cases from the bottom up, not from the top down, and focused on the fact that there is unique sets of factors in individual parts of the world that require different priorities and attention.

And ultimately, foreign policy – mature foreign policy – requires a balancing of interests.  That’s just a fact, okay?  Our human rights agenda is going to look different in certain parts of the world than it will in others.  That doesn’t mean that we as a people have abandoned it.  That means that in a world where you need to conduct real foreign policy in a mature and structured way, there are ways you’re going to have to balance all these —

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Actually, Senator Rubio, there’s – we’re making progress.  There’s protests in English now, so —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Remember last time?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  So we have to understand that, and that’s why we think it’s so important that our regional bureaus be at the core and at the heart of everything we do.  And so we feel good about that part of it.

By the same token, I think critical to this are some of the reforms we’re trying to make to foreign aid.  And I said, when I appeared before this committee, everything we do has to make us stronger, safer, or more prosperous.  So we’ve undertaken a review of our foreign aid, and the reality is that there are many of these programs – they may – some are good programs.  Some make all the sense in the world, and we wanted to pursue those programs.

(Protest utterances.)

CHAIRMAN RISCH:  Go ahead.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Some of these programs make all the sense in the world, but frankly, on the priority scale, perhaps other programs are more important.  Others, frankly, made no sense at all.  We can talk about some of those programs today.  We funded things around the world that made absolutely no sense.

I will say this:  Even with the reforms we’ve put in place and what we’re suggesting as changes to our foreign aid, we still will provide more foreign aid, more humanitarian support than the next 10 countries combined, than the entire OECD, and far more than China.  China doesn’t do humanitarian aid.  China does predatory lending.  That’s what Belt and Road Initiative is.  That’s what all of their aid – they have no – zero record of doing humanitarian aid in the world, and frankly, they don’t know how to do it.  They have no interest in doing it.  What they’re very good at is going into some country, making you a loan, and then holding that debt over your head.  And that’s what they continue to do, and by the way, you have to hire a Chinese company to do it.

So I don’t agree with this assessment that – there’s no evidence whatsoever that China has either the capacity or the will to replace the U.S. in humanitarian assistance, in food deliveries, or in developmental assistance, for that matter.  We provide development assistance.  They provide debt traps, and that’s a point over and over again around the world that we’ve made, and we’ve found receptive audiences to it.

Now, look, anytime you undertake reforms of this magnitude, of – that needed to be made, you’re going to have hiccups and you’re also going to have controversy.  But these reforms had to happen.  At USAID, 12 cents of every dollar was reaching the recipient.  That means that in order for us to get aid to somebody, we had to spend all this other money supporting this foreign aid industrial complex.  We’re going to find more efficient ways to deliver aid to people directly, and it’s going to be directed by our regional bureaus, and it’s going to sponsor programs that make a difference, and it’s going to be part of a holistic approach to our foreign policy.  And I look forward to engaging with this committee and the appropriators as well in ensuring that we get to the right place on that.

I – my last point I would make, and this is something I am very proud of – I believe – and I’m not besmirching anyone else, but I believe that the approach we have taken at the State Department – and, frankly, at USAID, but at the State Department – to move forward reforms that involved intake from all of our partners, that required that input from people within the building – many of the reforms we’ve made were driven by people inside the building, many of whom have worked there for 20 or 30 years.  And now we are engaged with Congress, both in the House and Senate, in a comment period where we’re taking many of your comments and are making changes to our organizational proposals that we look forward to bringing back to you with an official congressional notification.  And even after that there’ll be an opportunity to move forward.

But the State Department had to change.  I’m telling you it was no longer at the center of American foreign policy.  It had often been replaced by the National Security Council or by some other agency of government when, in fact, we have these highly talented people who – many of whom have served in multiple posts around the world and have a holistic view of how foreign policy needs to be conducted that were being edged out.  Because you know what?  When I get a decision memo early on at the State Department and they would hand me these memos, there were 40 boxes on this piece of paper.  That means 40 people had to check off yes, okay before it even got to me.  That’s ridiculous.  That takes too long.  That’s why people said don’t use State Department.  They take too long and it’s too cumbersome.  And if any one of those little boxes didn’t get checked, the memo didn’t move up the chain.

That can’t continue.  We can’t move at that pace in this world.  Events happen quickly, and we have to be able to move at the pace of relevance.  And so I hope to work with you in a productive way to make that possible.  You’re not going to like all the changes, but I want you to know what the intent of the changes are.  It is not to dismantle American foreign policy and it is not to withdraw us from the world, because I just hit 18 countries in 18 weeks.  That doesn’t sound like much of a withdrawal.  And I see some of these foreign ministers, including individuals from Ukraine, more than I’ve seen my own children, and I talk to them at least three times a week.  We are engaged in the world, but we’re going to be engaged in a world that makes sense and that’s smart.  And that isn’t about saving money; it is about ensuring that we are delivering to our people what they deserve: a foreign policy that makes America stronger, safer, and more prosperous.

140525,Imposing Sanctions on China- and Iran-based Entities and Individuals that Support Iran’s Ballistic Missile Program,"Today, the United States is sanctioning entities and individuals primarily based in China and Hong Kong for their support to Iran’s ballistic missile program.  Iran remains heavily reliant on China to conduct its malign activities in the Middle East.  This is another example of how the CCP and China-based companies provide key economic and technical support to Iran and its proxies driving regional instability and threatening U.S. partners and allies.

Specifically, these entities and individuals are supporting Iran’s efforts to indigenize the manufacturing of carbon fiber for use in Iran’s ballistic missile program.  These entities and individuals support the supply of carbon fiber, its precursors, and carbon fiber manufacturing equipment to the various Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) sub-organizations that oversee this effort, including U.S.-designated IRGC Aerospace Force Research and Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization (IRGC ASF RSSJO) and IRGC Research and Self Sufficiency Jehad Organization (IRGC RSSJO).

Today’s action is part of President Trump’s National Security Presidential Memorandum-2, which employs maximum pressure to curtail Iran’s ballistic missile program and disrupt, degrade, and deny the IRGC and its terrorist proxies the resources necessary to sustain their destabilizing activities.

The United States will use all available means, including sanctions on entities based in third countries, to expose and disrupt Iran’s schemes to procure equipment and items supporting its ballistic missile program, which destabilizes the Middle East and beyond.

But of course, Secretary Rubio has made his position clear about the kinds of individuals who are going to have their visas revoked or not – not renewed, involving whether or not their actions affect our foreign policy interests, or the opposite of what it is they said that they would be doing here, if they engage in certain kind of behavior. So but what we will do is see how the Secretary feels about this, and I do expect to talk with him a little bit later, but so we’ll take that back and get it back to you, because I know you’re going to be reporting on that. But we’ll do that.

QUESTION: Thank you very much, Tammy. I have two questions, one on the U.S. diplomatic missions, another one is China and Russia, if I may. Regarding the closure of U.S. diplomatic missions overseas, can you confirm that the United States is considering closing the diplomatic missions in 27 countries around the world? And will it also close its consulate in Busan, South Korea?

And the second question: It has been reported that Chinese companies are producing missiles in Russia, and that Russia’s Kremlin announced that it would strengthen solidarity with China to celebrate the Victory Days. What are your concerns about China and Russia’s military cooperating?

MS BRUCE: Well, what I’ve said several times in this podium is that there are several nations that are responsible for helping move the carnage that is unfolding in Ukraine in this war, that many nations are responsible for the nature of how it continues. And I’ve stated that several times, the State Department has as well, and so I’m going to leave that there.

Regarding our missions and our consulates, I have nothing to report for you at this point regarding the nature of what will be transpiring, but I will ask if we can take another look at perhaps – if there are announcements or any updates on that particular dynamic, we’ll get back to you, certainly.",USA
010525,Secretary of State Marco Rubio with Sean Hannity of Fox News,"QUESTION:  And welcome to Hannity.  We start tonight with a Fox News alert.  At this hour, President Trump delivering a spirited commencement address at the University of Alabama.  We will check in with that live in just a few moments.  But first, a major announcement from the White House.  Mike Waltz has been nominated now to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio will now fill in as Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor while continuing to lead the State Department. 

Now, in case you’re keeping track, this means that Secretary of State Rubio is now the Secretary of State, the National Security Advisor, the Acting USAID Administrator, and the Acting Archivist.  I mean, you’ve got a lot.  Now on X, Vice President J.D. Vance actually was very funny, remarking, quote, “I think he could take on a bit more.  If only there was a job opening for a devout Catholic…”  When does conclave start?  I think the 7th.

Here now with more is Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  Mr. Secretary, you’ve got to admit that was pretty funny.  I like that.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  No, we thought about it, but you have to – it’s an unmarried Catholic male.  You don’t have to be a priest.  Any – people don’t know that.  Any unmarried Catholic male can be pope, but I got married and I’m happily married, so I guess I’ll miss out on that one.

QUESTION:  I know.  And by the way, you have a great – you’ve got a great family and your son’s a great football player and I know you’re very proud, and you should be. 

Look, we’ve been friends a long time.  Really – and I’m happy for Mike Waltz, by the way.  I think he’ll be a great UN ambassador, and we need one.  And you – your wheelhouse has always been foreign policy.  I’ve known you forever.  This is your passion.  Your heart is here.  These are consequential times.  We’ve got Europe, we’ve got Russia-Ukraine, we’ve got the Middle East, we have Iran, and then we have this – our number one geopolitical foe, China. 

Let’s start in Europe.  Let’s start with Putin.  You said this week may be the deciding week for him.  Clearly, the minerals deal yesterday was a big win for the President and the White House.  Where do we stand with Putin?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, let’s remind everybody this is not our war.  I mean, this is a war that started under Joe Biden.  For three years it went on.  They made no effort to sort of bring it to a conclusion.  And it’s a war that has no military solution:  in essence, Putin can’t take all of Ukraine; Ukraine can’t push the Russians all the way back to where they were in 2014. 

And so the question here is, who is the only leader in the world that can talk to both sides and hopefully bring them to a deal, and that’s President Trump.  And that’s what he’s tried to do.  For a hundred days he has done efforts to bring about peace, to end the killing, to end the dying, to end the destruction.  You know that Ukraine – it’s going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild that country.

And so the President has tried.  Look, we’ve gotten closer.  We – for the first time – we haven’t known this for three years – we kind of can see what it would take for Ukraine to stop.  We can see what it would take for the Russians to stop.  The problem is those two positions are still a little far apart. 

And look, we’re not going to give up on it in the sense that we’re not going to be ready to help if we can, but there does come a point where the President has to decide how much more time at the highest levels of our government do you dedicate it, when maybe one of the two sides or both aren’t really close enough when we’ve got so many – I would argue even more important – issues going on around the world.  Not that a war in Ukraine is not important, but I would say what’s happening with China is more important in the long term for the future of the world.  Obviously, Iran’s nuclear ambition, all these other things that we have going on.

So at some point in time, it either has to be something that can happen or we all need to move on.  That’ll be a decision the President will have to make. 

QUESTION:  Well, I will say this:  The consequences are really dire in every situation that you’re referring to.  Let me go back to Putin for one more second.  I mean, the mineral deal – I don’t think we can under – I don’t think we can overstate how important that’s going to be for Ukraine’s security, the relationship they will have now moving forward with the United States.  That’s a big part of the puzzle.

It’s important, I think, for people to understand in the four years when Donald Trump was president from 2017 till he left office in 2021, no problems with Vladimir Putin.  But in 2014, 11 years ago, that’s when Crimea was annexed.  When Joe Biden was president and Putin was amassing troops on the border and military equipment on the border, he’s asked, well what happens if he invades?  Of course he was going to invade.  He said well, it depends if it’s a minor incursion. 

And it makes you wonder – nobody ever dared to pick up a phone and even attempt or try to stop it from happening.  That to me is unconscionable.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.

QUESTION:  In your heart, do you feel like – are you close?  I mean, you’re in the middle of this.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  Well, I’m glad you gave everybody that lesson because that’s – not only did it happen in 2014 under President Obama, but during that time the Obama administration refused to provide the Ukrainians any military weapons.  They would provide them blankets and sheets and towels and – but they wouldn’t give them weapons.

Donald Trump, when he was president the first time, provided them the weapons that actually helped stop the Russian tanks from taking Kyiv even when he was no longer in the White House a few years later.  This invasion would have never happened if Donald Trump were in the White House, but it did.  It happened under Joe Biden.  It happened just a few months after the fiasco in Afghanistan.  And I think everyone realizes Putin saw that and said now is my time to go, I have a weak president under Joe Biden, and he went.  And this war dragged on for three years.

Look, you asked how close we are.  I think we know where Ukraine is and we know where Russia is right now and where Putin is.  They’re still far apart.  They’re closer, but they’re still far apart.  And it’s going to take a real breakthrough here very soon to make this possible, or I think the President is going to have to make a decision about how much more time we’re going to dedicate to this.

And you’re right about the minerals deal.  It’s good for America because we’ve invested a lot of money in this war.  It’s also good for Ukraine because it’s going to help them be able to develop their economy and rebuild when this war ends. 

QUESTION:  Well, they’re going to need a lot of money to rebuild. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  They are.

QUESTION:  Okay, let’s move to the Middle East and let’s move to what happens in Gaza.  It can no longer remain a launching pad for their missiles, Hamas missiles, to be fired into Israel.  That we agree on.  I know the President has said and you have said and Steve Witkoff has said – everybody has said – the Iranians cannot have a nuclear weapon.  The only reason they’re close is because Joe Biden put a blind eye towards the sanctions that were bankrupting Iran, as far as I’m concerned.

However, they are closer than they have ever been.  To me, a deal with Iran would have to include the following: Their enrichment would have to be stopped, their facilities shut down by Americans; we would need anywhere anyplace anytime American inspectors, not international inspectors.  Why in my heart of hearts do I not believe that the mullahs of Iran would ever agree to that, and do you agree that those should be the conditions?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  If Iran wants a peaceful civil nuclear program, meaning they want nuclear power plants like other countries in the world have, there’s a way to do it.  And that is you build the reactors and you import enriched uranium to fuel those reactors.  That’s how dozens of countries around the world do it.

The only countries in the world that enrich uranium are the ones that have nuclear weapons.  Iran is at – they’re claiming they don’t want a weapon, but they would be – what they’re basically asking is to be the only non-weapon country in the world that’s enriching uranium. 

And the level at which they enrich it is really not relevant per se because, really, if you have the ability to enrich at 3.67 percent, it only takes a few weeks to get to 20 percent and then 60 percent and then the 80 and 90 percent that you need for a weapon. 

And so that really is the path forward here.  Iran simply needs to say we’ve agreed to no longer enrich, we’re going to have reactors because we want nuclear energy, and we’re going to import enriched uranium.  This is an opportunity for them if they take it.  This is – and this is the best opportunity they’re going to have.  President Trump is a president of peace.  He doesn’t want a war.  He doesn’t want conflict.  None of us do.  And there’s a path forward here.  But what cannot happen is to live in a world where Iran has a nuclear weapon.

QUESTION:  There’s a path forward.  The path forward has been given to them.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It has.

QUESTION:  And now it’s a matter of whether or not they’re going to take it.  And the President was very, very clear he would lead the effort to stop them from ever achieving that nuclear weapon.  And that would mean – that statement was obvious in terms of that he would use military force to destroy those facilities.  We have the capacity, obviously, to do it.

But back to this question:  Would we need American inspectors and American scientists to shut it down, and would that have to be part of the deal, and anywhere anyplace anytime American inspectors?  Would they have to agree to that in your mind?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  I think you would have to allow Americans as part of – you can send – maybe there’ll be French inspectors, there’ll be Italian inspectors, there’ll be Saudis, whoever.  But I think you cannot basically say we will not allow any Americans.

You also have to make sure – if you really want to prevent a nuclear program, okay, and you’re not building a nuclear weapon, then you should open all your facilities.  One of the failures of the Biden – I’m sorry – of the Obama nuclear deal with Iran is that you could not inspect military sites.  Well, if you’re making nuclear weapons, you would probably make them on a military site.  And by the way, it’s been known and discovered that in the past Iran has had a secret nuclear program that it did not disclose to the world.

So I think if in fact – Iran likes to say they’re not interested in nuclear weapons.  They like to say all they want is peaceful nuclear energy.  Then they should not be afraid of inspections by inspectors of any kind, including Americans.

And look, there’s a win here for Iran, okay?  They can actually have real economic development, can have real investment in their country, but they have to walk away from sponsoring terrorists, they have to walk away from helping the Houthis, they have to walk away from building long-range missiles that have no purpose to exist other than having nuclear weapons, and they have to walk away from enrichment. 

These are not unreasonable requests.  There are countries all over the world that have nuclear energy and don’t enrich and don’t have long-range missiles and don’t sponsor terrorism.  That path is there for them.  It’s the path of peace.  And frankly, I pray and hope, and we’ll do everything we can to help convince them that they should take it. 

QUESTION:  I have the same prayer that you do.  And they know what the consequences will be, and they will probably lose their nuclear sites, they’ll lose their refineries.  And if that’s the case, that would probably result in poverty and regime change. 

Last question, China.  You’re right.  I view them, as you do, as our top geopolitical foe.  Things seem to be heated in public.  Are there any things going on behind the scenes that give you some hope that hopefully, for example, on trade and tariffs we can come to some type of agreement?  Because they put tariffs on basically every American product and it’s just – they’ve been ripping us off forever.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  They have.  They’ve been ripping off the world.  And look, yes, there’s efforts.  You can see that, look, this is hurting the Chinese economy.  People forget that the factories where all these shoes and shirts and clothing and all that stuff that comes from China, those are all Chinese jobs.  When they say that the containers, that the factories are not going to be sending things to America, that means they’re out of a job.  This is hurting the Chinese economy badly.

I think there’s two questions.  Can we reach some sort of short-term accommodation with them?  That’s what they want.  I mean, the Chinese are reaching out.  They want to meet.  They want to talk.  We’ve got people involved in that.  Obviously, our Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is involved in those efforts and their talks will come up soon. 

But I think there’s a broader question, and that is whether we shouldn’t – this is a wakeup call that we truly need to become a country that can make more things in America and not be as dependent on China.  We were far too dependent on China.  We allowed them through unfair trade practices to de-industrialize us and to use not just tariffs but non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, dumping.  We’ve allowed them to use all of those things to —

QUESTION:  Intellectual property theft.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  And stealing intellectual property, and really left us de-industrialized as a country and heavily dependent on them.  That’s a very dangerous place to be, and President Trump is taking it on, and he’s doing it now because it needs to be done now.  It cannot wait any longer.  Two more years in this direction and we are going to be in a lot of trouble, really dependent on China.  So I do think there’s this broader question about how much we should buy from them at all moving forward.

QUESTION:  Well, Godspeed, Mr. Secretary.  These are consequential and transformational times, and you’re right in the middle of all of it.  And we wish you the best for the sake of the world, and I hope some of these people understand the seriousness of the President.  Sometimes they might underestimate him.

Mr. Secretary, thank you.",USA
270425,Secretary of State Marco Rubio With Kristen Welker of NBC Meet the Press,"QUESTION:  All right, Mr. Secretary, let’s turn to China and the President’s trade war.  President Trump said he has spoken directly with President Xi Jinping.  Chinese officials, though, say that no talks have taken place about a trade war.  Can you help us to understand where this stands?  Has President Trump spoken to President Xi after imposing those 145 percent tariffs? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I mean, just like the previous answer, I think I’m not going to be commenting on who talked to who and what they talked about, because obviously this is also a high-stakes negotiation.  The fundamental fact is this:  For 30-something years, the Chinese have gotten away with unfair trade practices – not just unfair, outrageously unfair trade practices.

QUESTION:  Yeah.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  It’s just very simple.  Chinese companies can do whatever they want in America.  American companies can only do what the Chinese allow them to do in China, and it’s very limited, and every year it gets more and more limited.  They flood not just us but they flood the world with exports, but they push back against any imports.  They are 100 percent favorable to their – unfairly favorable to their companies and unfair to ours.

They steal our intellectual property.  They reverse-engineer things they get ahold of.  I mean, it’s on and on and on unfair, and they’ve been allowed to get away with it.  And finally – almost too late, really, but finally – we have a president that stood up to it. 

And it’s not just us that needs to be standing up to it, by the way.  Europe is concerned about the number of electric cars that China tried to dump on them.  China has had trade problems with Canada and with others.  This needs to stop.

So the bottom line is that the President is dealing with something that should have been dealt with a very long time ago, and it was almost too late.

QUESTION:  So, Mr. Secretary, just to be clear, you can’t confirm that a phone call has taken place between President Trump and President Xi of China post the —

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I don’t comment on the phone calls the President makes —

QUESTION:  Okay.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  — with foreign leaders.

QUESTION:  All right.  Sorry.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, I think I’d direct you to the White House.

QUESTION:  Okay.

170425,"Department Press Briefing – April 17, 2025","Moreover, we can confirm the reporting that Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd. is directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests. Their actions and Beijing’s support of the company, even after our private engagements with them, is yet another example of China’s empty claims to support peace. We urge our partners to judge the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese companies on their actions, not their empty words. Restoring freedom of navigation in the Red Sea is a priority to President Trump. Beijing should take this priority seriously when considering any future support of CGSTL. The United States will not tolerate anyone providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis.

Now, as part of President Trump’s unwavering defense of free speech, Secretary Rubio has permanently shut down the State Department’s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference office – formerly the Global Engagement Center. As Secretary Rubio stated, “Over the past half decade, [the] bodies like GEC [have called] by our own governing ruling class, nearly destroyed America’s long free speech history.” We have launched a sweeping transparency initiative. The American people deserve answers, and we intend to deliver them. Most of you will recall, of course, the effort to censor Americans using certain entities here in the government, including that one here at the State Department.

QUESTION: China. You probably have heard President Zelenskyy’s latest statement on China, saying that China supplies Russia with manpower, gun power, and even helps them to manufacture some weapons inside Russia. This sort of goes back to your earlier statement a couple of days ago about China providing nearly 80 percent of dual-use supplies to Russia. There are calls from the Congress, bipartisan calls, urging the administration to come up with sanctions on China. Are you planning to take any action to prevent this from happening?

MS BRUCE: Well, we know, of course – I don’t need to mention the word “tariffs” to everyone, but these are things that are not about punishment of any one nation, but it’s about a fair playing field. And that’s relevant, certainly proving that President Trump not only isn’t shy about engaging with China, he’s not shy about engaging with anyone. And that’s one thing the American people know. And I think also our commentary and the nature of the actions we’re taking in general when it comes to China’s choices have been clear.

One thing I – speaking of China and the nature of what they’re involved in, I will tell you something – it’s a little bit out of the Ukraine region – is that there is a Chinese company providing satellite imagery to the Houthis – the Houthis – and we are aware of those reports. That has been, I think, reported originally perhaps by the Financial Times. But China consistently attempts, as you know, to frame itself as a global peacemaker. And however, it is clear that Beijing and China-based companies provide key economic and technical support to regimes like Russia, North Korea, and Iran and its proxies. The CCP continues to enable these regimes, whether it be through the provision of dual-use items Russia needs to sustain its war in Ukraine, North Korea’s ballistic missile development, or Iran’s support of terrorism across the Middle East.

And just taking you back to my topper bit on Chang Guang, this – it’s a dynamic where it’s clear, as we’re learning, their engagement with war and the suffering of people globally, and of course that remains unacceptable. Beijing’s support, by the way, of that company, the satellite company, even after we’ve engaged in discussions with them about this – the fact that they continue to do this is unacceptable, certainly contradicts their claims of being peace supporters. And we urge our partners to judge the CCP and Chinese companies, again, on their actions and not their words.

QUESTION: Yes, Tammy, thank you for the question. I wanted to ask you, we saw a short time ago today President Zelenskyy speaking with reporters in Kyiv and accusing China of supplying weapons to Russia and saying that he will present detailed evidence next week. Does the U.S. have a similar assessment of China’s role directly in weapons, not just technology but with actual armed support for Russia?

MS BRUCE: Well, the specifics of their support, which I’ve spoken about a great deal when it comes to Russia and this war – as well as, as I’ve mentioned a few times here in this briefing, their support of Iran and particularly the Houthis – I’m not going to get into the specifics of what sectors that is in. But I think we’ve been very clear about our concern regarding China. Yes, ma’am.",USA

The United States is also imposing sanctions on several companies and vessels involved in facilitating Iranian oil shipments to China as part of Iran’s “shadow” fleet. This is the United States’ second action against an independent China-based teapot refinery since President Trump issued National Security Presidential Memorandum 2 on February 4, 2025.

All sanctions will be fully enforced under the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign on Iran.

China has actively undermined the world trading order for decades; it is high time to correct that imbalance. President Trump is the first world leader brave enough to do so.

They’re saying that Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret meeting last December that they were behind a widespread series of cyber attacks on American infrastructure, and they linked the attacks to escalation over Taiwan.

China provides nearly 80 percent of the dual-use items Russia needs to sustain the war. Eighty percent comes from China.

QUESTION:  Hi.  Thank you, Tammy.  You got questions about this on Monday.  It will have been almost a week since there was the announcement about termination of funds to USAGM broadcasters such as Voice of America and other grantees.  As a senator, Secretary Rubio was supportive of the U.S. grantee broadcaster Radio Free Asia.  He protected it from cutbacks in the past.  Does he want to revive the funding for Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts into countries like China, Cambodia, and Vietnam?  And is he aware that due to the funding termination, a number of the journalists who work for Radio Free Asia are potentially facing – could face deportation back to countries like China and Vietnam, where they may face imprisonment as a consequence of the reporting work that they’ve done for the U.S. Government by working for this outlet?  And the same goes for Voice of America journalists who also risk deportation back to countries such as Russia, Myanmar, Belarus, China, and Vietnam.  Do you have a comment?

MS BRUCE:  Well, I did have that question, and I have the question out to the Secretary.  It’s something that I’m following up with as well.  It has been a story, understandably.  You’re interested in the answers to this, so I’m going directly to him.  It’s a – it’s – he’s a busy guy, but as – I’m going to continue to look for that from him.  What I can tell you also, though, is that we’re reducing, clearly – he was elected in large part to reduce the federal bureaucracy, right? It’s about waste and fraud, mismanagement.  This is something that has to occur, and in any dynamic there’s going to be actions and tough decisions that have to be made.  It’s – many of us personally also have to go through that when you’re looking at a budget. 

The President continues to take action to ensure the whole of the United States Government, including Executive Branch agencies, are in line with the administration’s policy priorities.  And I’ve said before, I have to keep saying, is that many, many things are fluid, and it’s why – it’s good – why you’re here and why now we’re doing this three days a week, but also when we address the issue, as I asked about the issue of visas.  There are people who are reporting certain things, and like in any situation, if you’re in the United States and you are – and you have to leave, you can also apply for asylum.  If you are in a situation where you’re – where you believe your returning to your home country puts you at significant risk, we have, clearly, procedures where you can apply for asylum, and that is – certainly if someone is coming from that workplace or some other situation, that’s something that people can do. 

If you have a visa – and every situation is different.  That’s why we don’t discuss individual visa dynamics.  But if someone is here and it is a work visa and it’s – their employment has ended, there is a period of time – it’s like any other visa dynamic for anyone who holds a visa, and you can learn about that at state.gov.  You can talk to – there’s a whole host of people that can help you.  And if you – I would guess if you’re here on a work visa, that was probably a complicated, semi-complicated procedure, and so you’re aware of these things.  And so this is what is obvious for anyone in this kind of a situation, especially for those worried about the nature of reporting or a dynamic where they’re concerned about returning.  There are options like that, and that, again, is a very basic situation for everyone in that kind of a situation. 

Yes – yes, sir. ",USA
200325,Sanctioning Entities Purchasing and Transporting Iranian Oil to Further Impose Maximum Pressure on Iran,"The U.S. Department of State is today sanctioning Huaying Huizhou Daya Bay Petrochemical Terminal Storage, an oil terminal in China, for buying and storing Iranian crude oil from a sanctioned vessel.

The Department of the Treasury is concurrently sanctioning China-based Shandong Shouguang Luqing Petrochemical Co., Ltd., a “teapot” oil refinery, for purchasing and refining hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian crude oil.  This includes oil from vessels linked to Ansarallah (Houthis), a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and the U.S.-designated Iranian Ministry of Defense of Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL).  “Teapot” refiners are private Chinese refineries that are the primary purchasers of Iranian oil.  This will be the United States’ first designation of a teapot refinery.

In addition, the Department of the Treasury is sanctioning 12 entities and one individual, and identifying eight vessels as blocked property for being responsible for shipping millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China.  These vessels—are part of Iran’s “shadow fleet” of tankers that supply teapot refineries, including Luqing Petrochemical.

These sanctions are being imposed pursuant to President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign to drive Iran’s oil exports, including to China, to zero.  China is by far the largest importer of Iranian oil. The Iranian regime uses the revenue it generates from these sales to finance attacks on U.S. allies, support terrorism around the world, and pursue other destabilizing actions.

All these new sanctions will be fully enforced under the Trump Administration’s maximum pressure campaign.  So long as Iran attempts to generate oil revenues to fund its destabilizing activities, the United States will hold both Iran and all its sanctions-evading partners accountable.",USA
190325,Secretary of State Marco Rubio with Hugh Hewitt,"QUESTION:  Joined now by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.  Mr. Secretary, welcome back.  It’s good to have you.  Congratulations on assuming the top – the seventh floor.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Thank you.  It’s – I think we’re starting our tenth week or our ninth week.  I’ve lost count at this point, but a lot has happened in that period of time.  But it’s a great honor to be able to do this and to work for a president that I think is making history every day.

QUESTION:  Well, Mr. Secretary, you’ve been on this program since 2010, I think probably more than a hundred times, and you may remember my basic worldview is that America’s biggest adversary is China, People’s Republic of China; that General Secretary Xi is a tough, ruthless man.  He’s in an alliance with the fanatics in Iran and they present a real and present danger with us.  Do you share that worldview?  Can a diplomat say that?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think it’s certainly the biggest challenge we face.  Look, here’s the way I characterize it, because you’re right, I mean, we need to have relations with these countries.  But I think the story of the 21st century is going to be about what happened between the U.S. and China.  I think I said this during my confirmation hearing.  I think the Chinese believe that they are on a path towards becoming the most powerful nation on Earth, that it’s inevitable, it’s just a matter of time, and they seek to manage that rise in a way that – and avoid disruptions along the way if possible.

And look, if in fact they end up out-competing us, out-innovating us, outworking us, what have you, that’s one thing.  But for us to sort of unilaterally allow them to do that rise while not playing by the same rules, then that would be on us.  I think that’s what’s happened for the better part of 20 years.  There was this assumption that some made that if – that we should allow China to continue to cheat in rules of trade and commerce and intellectual property and that kind of thing, and if we let them do it, that eventually they’d become rich, and when they became rich they’d become just like us.  Well, that’s not what happened.  They became rich, but they’re not just like us.

So I would say they’re a rich and powerful country.  They’re going to be a rich and powerful country.  We need to engage with them because it’s irresponsible not to, but we also don’t want to live in a world where we depend on China for things that we need.

QUESTION:  Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that General Secretary Xi is upset about the deal you made in Panama about the canal, and today it was announced that Hong Kong Enterprise is going to delay opening a car plant in Mexico in retaliation for the attempt to get the canal back.  Do you care?  Are we going to get the canal control back in American hands?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, look, we didn’t give the canal to China, as the President says.  President Trump’s been very clear:  We built that canal, we turned it over to – he didn’t agree with that decision, but we turned it over to Panama.  We wake up one day and Chinese influence is all over the canal.  They – Hong Kong-based companies, which obviously have to respond to Chinese law, control all the key ports on – the key ports on both sides, the infrastructure deeply ingrained there benefited the Chinese, and that’s just not sustainable and it can’t continue.  We made our view very clear that we believe the treaty has been violated.  We had a great visit.  There’s a lot of follow-up to be done, but the President has been abundantly clear about it, and that is that the Panama Canal cannot be an outpost for the Chinese, because we built it and we intend to have influence over it, and because we didn’t turn it – like I said, we didn’t turn it over to the Chinese.  We turned it over to Panama, and that’s not the way it’s played out.

QUESTION:  So it’s obviously a flashpoint.  Flashpoints are best discussed at a summit.  Is there a summit in the offing between President Trump and General Secretary Xi, either here or there?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I think that meeting is eventually going to happen.  There isn’t one scheduled.  I think that time will come.  Obviously, as you know – and you’ve followed these things for a long time – and there needs to be a reason behind it.  It has to – we have to know what they’re meeting about and what the result of the meeting is going to be.  But there’s no doubt that that will happen.  The President has in his first term – he’ll do it again now – I mean, he’ll meet with any foreign leader, basically, if there’s a good reason to do so.  He’s – and look, I think that meeting will happen.  But there’s none scheduled at this moment.

QUESTION:  Now, when the President talked to me – it was President-elect last, in January – and we talked about Jimmy Lai, and he told me he would get Jimmy Lai out of jail.  Have you had any conversations with your Chinese counterparts about getting Mr. Lai out of jail?  Because he’s going to die pretty soon unless we get him out of that Hong Kong prison.

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, it’s a priority.  We’ve raised it in every possible form and they know that it’s important to us, and I think there are other countries as well that are very involved in raising this issue.  And that needs to happen, and we’re going to continue to raise it.  Obviously, with some of these things you want to be careful what we say in the media.  We don’t want to jeopardize any efforts.  But I think it’s important to know that it’s not something we’ve forgotten about and that it remains a priority, and I think other countries around the world are making the same point as well to the Chinese.

QUESTION:  Very good.  Now, the Iranian fanatics sell a lot of oil to China.  That’s the connection.  I want to move to the attack on the Houthis this weekend.  First of all, have the Houthis attacked us, or are they just putting out press releases over the last three days?  Because they put out a lot of press releases that they’re shooting at the Truman, and I understood Trump to say if they did that, the bombs would fall on Iran.  What is the situation, Mr. Rubio?

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, they’ve – look, they’ve – they say they attack.  I mean, they launch and then they get shot down 100 miles away before it even is a threat, so DOD’s had no problem defending.  They’re certainly not doing right now what they were doing at the peak of this thing, when they were attacking our Navy 150 times and global shipping 170 times.  Maybe I got those numbers inverted, but nonetheless unacceptable.",USA
140325,Announcement of a Visa Restriction Policy to Address the Forced Return of Uyghurs and Members of Other Ethnic or Religious Groups with Protection Concerns to China,"Today, I am announcing a new visa restriction policy that will apply to current or former foreign government officials responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return of Uyghurs or members of other ethnic or religious groups with protection concerns to China. We are committed to combating China’s efforts to pressure governments to forcibly return Uyghurs and other groups to China, where they are subject to torture and enforced disappearances.

I am immediately implementing this policy by taking steps to impose visa restrictions on current and former officials from the Government of Thailand responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return of 40 Uyghurs from Thailand on February 27.

050325,Justice Department Charges 12 Chinese Contract Hackers and Law Enforcement Officers in Global Computer Intrusion Campaigns,"Chinese Law Enforcement and Intelligence Services Leveraged China’s Reckless and Indiscriminate Hacker-for-Hire Ecosystem, Including the ‘APT 27’ Group, to Suppress Free Speech and Dissent Globally and to Steal Data from Numerous Organizations Worldwide,
Note: View the indictments in U.S. v. Wu Haibo et al., U.S. v. Yin Kecheng, U.S. v. Zhou Shuai et al. here.

The Justice Department, FBI, Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and Departments of State and the Treasury announced today their coordinated efforts to disrupt and deter the malicious cyber activities of 12 Chinese nationals, including two officers of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Ministry of Public Security (MPS), employees of an ostensibly private PRC company, Anxun Information Technology Co. Ltd. (安洵信息技术有限公司) also known as “i-Soon,” and members of Advanced Persistent Threat 27 (APT27).

These malicious cyber actors, acting as freelancers or as employees of i-Soon, conducted computer intrusions at the direction of the PRC’s MPS and Ministry of State Security (MSS) and on their own initiative. The MPS and MSS paid handsomely for stolen data. Victims include U.S.-based critics and dissidents of the PRC, a large religious organization in the United States, the foreign ministries of multiple governments in Asia, and U.S. federal and state government agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) in late 2024.

“The Department of Justice will relentlessly pursue those who threaten our cybersecurity by stealing from our government and our people,” said Sue J. Bai, head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. “Today, we are exposing the Chinese government agents directing and fostering indiscriminate and reckless attacks against computers and networks worldwide, as well as the enabling companies and individual hackers that they have unleashed. We will continue to fight to dismantle this ecosystem of cyber mercenaries and protect our national security.”

“The FBI is committed to protecting Americans from foreign cyber-attacks,” said Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran of the FBI’s Cyber Division. “Today’s announcements reveal that the Chinese Ministry of Public Security has been paying hackers-for-hire to inflict digital harm on Americans who criticize the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). To those victims who bravely came forward with evidence of intrusions, we thank you for standing tall and defending our democracy. And to those who choose to aid the CCP in its unlawful cyber activities, these charges should demonstrate that we will use all available tools to identify you, indict you, and expose your malicious activity for all the world to see.”

According to court documents, the MPS and MSS employed an extensive network of private companies and contractors in China to hack and steal information in a manner that obscured the PRC government’s involvement. In some cases, the MPS and MSS paid private hackers in China to exploit specific victims. In many other cases, the hackers targeted victims speculatively. Operating from their safe haven and motivated by profit, this network of private companies and contractors in China cast a wide net to identify vulnerable computers, exploit those computers, and then identify information that it could sell directly or indirectly to the PRC government. The result of this largely indiscriminate approach was more worldwide computer intrusion victims, more systems worldwide left vulnerable to future exploitation by third parties, and more stolen information, often of no interest to the PRC government and, therefore, sold to other third-parties. Additional information regarding the indictments and the PRC’s hacker-for-hire ecosystem is available in Public Service Announcements published by the FBI today.

U.S. v. Wu Haibo et al., Southern District of New York

Today, a federal court in Manhattan unsealed an indictment charging eight i-Soon employees and two MPS officers for their involvement, from at least in or around 2016 through in or around 2023, in the numerous and widespread hacking of email accounts, cell phones, servers, and websites. The Department also announced today the court-authorized seizure of the primary internet domain used by i-Soon to advertise its business.

“State-sponsored hacking is an acute threat to our community and national security,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky for the Southern District of New York. “For years, these 10 defendants — two of whom we allege are PRC officials — used sophisticated hacking techniques to target religious organizations, journalists, and government agencies, all to gather sensitive information for the use of the PRC. These charges will help stop these state-sponsored hackers and protect our national security. The career prosecutors of this office and our law enforcement partners will continue to uncover alleged state-sponsored hacking schemes, disrupt them, and bring those responsible to justice.”

The defendants remain at large and wanted by the FBI. Concurrent with today’s announcement,  the U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the identification or location of any person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of a foreign government, engages in certain malicious cyber activities against U.S. critical infrastructure in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The reward is offered for the following individuals who are alleged to have worked in various capacities to direct or carry out i-Soon’s malicious cyber activity:

Wu Haibo (吴海波), Chief Executive Officer
Chen Cheng (陈诚), Chief Operating Officer
Wang Zhe (王哲), Sales Director
Liang Guodong (梁国栋), Technical Staff
Ma Li (马丽), Technical Staff
Wang Yan (王堰), Technical Staff
Xu Liang (徐梁), Technical Staff
Zhou Weiwei (周伟伟), Technical Staff
Wang Liyu (王立宇), MPS Officer
Sheng Jing (盛晶), MPS Officer
i-Soon and its employees, to include the defendants, generated tens of millions of dollars in revenue as a key player in the PRC’s hacker-for-hire ecosystem. In some instances, i-Soon conducted computer intrusions at the request of the MSS or MPS, including cyber-enabled transnational repression at the direction of the MPS officer defendants. In other instances, i-Soon conducted computer intrusions on its own initiative and then sold, or attempted to sell, the stolen data to at least 43 different bureaus of the MSS or MPS in at least 31 separate provinces and municipalities in China. i-Soon charged the MSS and MPS between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully exploited. i-Soon also trained MPS employees how to hack independently of i-Soon and offered a variety of hacking methods for sale to its customers.

The defendants’ U.S.-located targets included a large religious organization that previously sent missionaries to China and was openly critical of the PRC government and an organization focused on promoting human rights and religious freedom in China. In addition, the defendants targeted multiple news organizations in the United States, including those that have opposed the CCP or delivered uncensored news to audiences in Asia, including China and the New York State Assembly, one of whose representatives had communicated with members of a religious organization banned in China.

The defendants’ foreign-located targets included a religious leader and his office, and a Hong Kong newspaper that i-Soon considered as being opposed to the PRC government. The defendants also targeted the foreign ministries of Taiwan, India, South Korea, and Indonesia.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ryan B. Finkel, Steven J. Kochevar, and Kevin Mead for the Southern District of New York and Trial Attorney Gregory J. Nicosia Jr. of the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case.

U.S. v. Yin Kecheng and U.S. v. Zhou Shuai et al., District of Columbia

Today, a federal court unsealed two indictments charging APT27 actors Yin Kecheng (尹可成) and Zhou Shuai (周帅) also known as “Coldface” for their involvement in the multi-year, for-profit computer intrusion campaigns dating back, in the case of Yin, to 2013. The Department also announced today court-authorized seizures of internet domains and computer server accounts used by Yin and Zhou to facilitate their hacking activity.

The defendants remain at large. View the FBI’s Wanted posters for Shuai and Kecheng here.

Concurrent with today’s announcement, the Department of States State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs is announcing two reward offers under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP) of up to $2 million each for information leading to the arrests and convictions, in any country, of malicious cyber actors Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, both Chinese nationals residing in China.

“These indictments and actions show this office’s long-standing commitment to vigorously investigate and hold accountable Chinese hackers and data brokers who endanger U.S. national security and other victims across the globe,” said Interim U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin Jr. for the District of Columbia. “The defendants in these cases have been hacking for the Chinese government for years, and these indictments lay out the strong evidence showing their criminal wrongdoing. We again demand that the Chinese government to put a stop to these brazen cyber criminals who are targeting victims across the globe and then monetizing the data they have stolen by selling it across China.”

The APT27 group to which Yin and Zhou belong is also known to private sector security researchers as “Threat Group 3390,” “Bronze Union,” “Emissary Panda,” “Lucky Mouse,” “Iron Tiger,” “UTA0178,” “UNC 5221,” and “Silk Typhoon.” As alleged in court documents, between August 2013 and December 2024, Yin, Zhou, and their co-conspirators exploited vulnerabilities in victim networks, conducted reconnaissance once inside those networks, and installed malware, such as PlugX malware, that provided persistent access. The defendants and their co-conspirators then identified and stole data from the compromised networks by exfiltrating it to servers under their control. Next, they brokered stolen data for sale and provided it to various customers, only some of whom had connections to the PRC government and military. For example, Zhou sold data stolen by Yin through i-Soon, whose primary customers, as noted above, were PRC government agencies, including the MSS and the MPS.

The defendants’ motivations were financial and, because they were profit-driven, they targeted broadly, rendering victim systems vulnerable well beyond their pilfering of data and other information that they could sell. Between them, Yin and Zhou sought to profit from the hacking of numerous U.S.-based technology companies, think tanks, law firms, defense contractors, local governments, health care systems, and universities, leaving behind them a wake of millions of dollars in damages.

The documents related to the seizure warrants, also unsealed today, further allege that Yin and Zhou continued to engage in hacking activity, including Yin’s involvement in the recently announced hack of Treasury between approximately September and December 2024. Virtual private servers used to conduct the Treasury intrusion belonged to, and were controlled by, an account that Yin and his co-conspirators established. Yin and his co-conspirators used that same account and other linked accounts they controlled to lease servers used for additional malicious cyber activity. The seizure warrant unsealed today allowed the FBI to seize the virtual private servers and other infrastructure used by the defendants to perpetrate these crimes.

On Jan. 17, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced sanctions against Yin for his role in hacking that agency between September and December 2024. Concurrent with today’s indictments, OFAC also announced sanctions on Zhou and Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company Ltd., a company operated by Zhou for purposes of his hacking activity.

Private sector partners are also taking voluntary actions to raise awareness and strengthen defenses against the PRC’s malicious cyber activity. Today, Microsoft published research that highlights its unique, updated insights into Silk Typhoon tactics, techniques, and procedures specifically its targeting of the IT supply chain.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jack F. Korba and Tejpal S. Chawla for the District of Columbia and Trial Attorney Tanner Kroeger of the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case.

The above disruptive actions targeting PRC malicious cyber activities were the result of investigations conducted by FBI New York and Washington Field Offices, FBI Cyber Division, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the Southern District of New York and District of Columbia and the National Security Division’s National Security Cyber Section are prosecuting the case.

The Department acknowledges the value of public-private partnerships in combating advanced cyber threats and recognizes Microsoft, Volexity, PwC, and Mandiant for their valuable assistance in these investigations.

Zhou’s alleged participation in the Chinese hacking eco-system dates back to the late 1990’s.  He is the owner of 上海黑英信息技术有限公司, a/k/a Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company, which he established in or around 2010.  Since that time, Shanghai Heiying employed a cadre of Chinese Nationals known to conduct Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) activity world-wide.  Zhou is also known to have extensive contacts within the Chinese hacking eco-system and the Chinese government.

An FBI investigation of APT27, which began in approximately 2014, resulted in two separate indictments in the District of Columbia.  Zhou was charged in the second indictment with a conspiracy related to computer network intrusion activity occurring from roughly 2018 to 2020.  Zhou is charged with wire fraud, money laundering, aggravated identity theft, and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

This act runs counter to the Thai people’s longstanding tradition of protection for the most vulnerable and is inconsistent with Thailand’s commitment to protect human rights. We urge all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China.

China, under the direction and control of the Chinese Communist Party, has committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. We call on Chinese authorities to provide full access to verify the well-being of the returned Uyghurs on a regular basis.

It’s not like during the Bush years, where it was – were much more neocon-y on the right, and now there’s a real division within the right, within MAGA even, on how – what should we do about Ukraine, as most of the party I think wants nothing to do with that anymore; how – what kind of saber-rattling should we do – be doing about Iran.  There’s a large strain that believes none, we should be focused on China and we should stop demonizing Iran and Russia and keep our eye on our biggest threat.  I know you think they’re our biggest threat as well.  So how – just give me the 30,000-foot-level view of how you’re going to navigate that fracture. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  Well, I think we spend a lot of time in American politics debating tactics, like what we’re going to do, who we’re going to sanction, what letter we’re going to send or whatever.  I think it really has to start with strategy:  What is the strategic objective?  What’s the purpose, the mission?  And I think the mission of American foreign policy – and this may sound sort of obvious, but I think it’s been lost.  The interest of American foreign policy is to further the national interest of the United States of America, right?  I mean, every — 

QUESTION:  America first. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, and that’s the way the world has always worked.  The way the world has always worked is that the Chinese will do what’s in the best interests of China, the Russians will do what’s in the best interest of Russia, the Chileans are going to do what’s in the best interest of Chile, and the United States needs to do what’s in the best interest of the United States.  Where our interests align, that’s where you have partnerships and alliances; where our differences are not aligned, that is where the job of diplomacy is to prevent conflict while still furthering our national interests and understanding they’re going to further theirs.  And that’s been lost. 

And I think that was lost at the end of the Cold War, because we were the only power in the world, and so we assumed this responsibility of sort of becoming the global government in many cases, trying to solve every problem.  And there are terrible things happening in the world.  There are.  And then there are things that are terrible that impact our national interest directly, and we need to prioritize those again.  So it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power.  That was not – that was an anomaly.  It was a product of the end of the Cold War, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet.  We face that now with China and to some extent Russia, and then you have rogue states like Iran and North Korea you have to deal with.   

QUESTION:  The New York Times said okay, you guys got away with this with Colombia, but you’re not going to be able to pull that trick with Russia, with China, with Iran.  If you try to sort of bully these stronger nations in this way, it’s not going to go very well.  Is that a fair point?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, we’re not interested in bullying anybody and we don’t feel like we bullied Colombia.  We feel like we had a deal.  Colombia signed a deal.  They signed a piece of paper that said yes, send us these airplanes, and then halfway into the flight they broke it.  And so our answer was, well, now we flew these planes, we had to bring them back to the United States, so now you’re going to come pick them up.  Why are we going to pay for those flights because you canceled them?  It’s not bullying.  It’s they broke a contract that we had made with them. 

Obviously, look, China has nuclear weapons.  They’re tough people.  There’s no doubt about it.  They’re a tough people, they have nuclear weapons, they’re a great power with a large economy – they’re going to be a global power.  But it can’t come at our expense.  And so ultimately when you’re dealing with great powers like China, it’s going to be at the highest levels of their president and ours or their premier and ours – and our president, and that interaction will happen.  In the case of Russia, the same.  Obviously, there’s going to be – whatever happens with Russia will be a Putin-Trump dynamic.   

But I think most certainly, sure, I mean, the world is – the way you treat – not the way you treat countries, but the way you approach a nation has to be based on the strategic balance.  But I don’t view that we bullied Colombia, nor do I think these articles about oh, they’re going to turn to China – that’s absurd.  That’s an absurd argument.  I think the overwhelming majority of people in Colombia, a country I know very well, don’t even like their president.  I mean, this guy had an election today, he’d lose.   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  So I don’t pay a lot of – most of the people, unfortunately, that opine on – the more I have been delved into foreign policy and the more I read people who claim to know about foreign policy, the more I realize that a lot of the people we believe are experts have no idea what they’re talking about. 

QUESTION:  There’s a large delta.  What about – you mentioned China.  Did you recently have a call with the – their – the foreign minister?   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  The foreign minister. 

QUESTION:  And there was a report that you were – you received a sort of warning that you needed to basically watch —  

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah, somebody told me that.  And that’s – so two things that – the game that they play.  Number one is they put out an English translation and they put out a Chinese translation, and they don’t always overlap.  The call was very straightforward, and I basically said you’re acting in the best interest of China, we’re going to act in the best interest of America.  We’re two great powers.  And in areas where we can work together, there’s probably no problem in the world we couldn’t solve working together; in areas where we have disagreements, we have a responsibility to manage it so it doesn’t escalate into something catastrophic.  But be clear that we’re going to do these things. 

I did not – at least the translator that was on the call did not say anything to me that I felt was over the top.  But then they put out these games.  They like to play these games.  They put out these translations where it says one thing in English and then it’s translated in a different – they use a different term in Mandarin – so like he was warned not to overstep himself – they never said that.  And if they had, I would have told them, well, I would say the same to you – don’t overstep either.  And – but that didn’t happen, at least not on the call, or at least maybe their interpreter didn’t want to interpret it that way.   

QUESTION:  Right.   

SECRETARY RUBIO:  But that was not the readout we got.  But it’s silly and irrelevant.  What really matters is the decisions we make moving forward.  And China wants to be the most powerful country in the world and they want to do so at our expense, and that’s not in our national interest, and we’re going to address it.  We don’t want a war over it, but we’re going to address it. 

QUESTION:  Well, that brings us – well, we have more on China, but that brings us to Panama, where you’re about to go.  And China is obviously playing a role down there, is one of the reasons why Trump has been saying – President Trump has been saying we want the canal back; we never intended to give it to the Chinese.  That was never the game plan.  They don’t technically control the Panama Canal, but they do have interests down there.  Can you explain it so people can understand it? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  So, well, they’re all over Panama.  A few years ago, Panama made the decision that they were going to de-recognize Taiwan and align with Beijing.  And with that came all sorts of money that was provided to the then president’s administration to – for projects and things of that nature, but also Chinese investment.  And one of the main investments they have is in these two port facilities on both – on the entry – on both sides of the canal.  And all kinds of other infrastructure, cranes and the like.  And so people will argue, well, that’s not China; that’s a company based in Hong Kong.  Well, a company based in Hong Kong is the Government of China.  You are not a company in China if the Chinese Government doesn’t control you.  It’s similar to the argument about ByteDance and TikTok, which is – every company that operates from China or Hong Kong, which is controlled by China – more than ever controlled by China; it’s no longer autonomous – they have to do whatever the government tells them.  And if the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to.  And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so.  That is a direct threat. 

So it’s a technicality, but in reality if China wanted to obstruct traffic in the Panama Canal, they could.  That’s a fact.  And it’s my view that’s a violation of the treaty agreement, and that’s what President Trump is raising, and we’re going to address that topic.  It’s one of the concerns.  That dynamic cannot continue – not simply because we built it at great cost in lives and treasure, but because it is contrary to our national interest.  It is not in the national interest of the United States to have a canal we paid for and we built used as a leverage and a weapon against us.  That can’t happen. 

QUESTION:  So what’s the solution? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, that’s what we’re going to have to talk about.  And I think the President’s been pretty clear he wants to administer the canal again.  Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea.  But we’re – that message has been brought very clear.  And there are a lot of other areas we can work very closely with Panama on.  I mean, their government generally is pro-American on a number of fronts.  But this is a core national interest for us.  We can work together on a lot of things, and there are a lot of things we can work with them on that are very positive on migration, and they can be very helpful on all sorts of things.  And I hope we’ll get resolution to those very soon.  But that does not in any way replace the core reality that the Panama Canal, we cannot allow any foreign power – particularly China – to hold that kind of potential control over it that they do.  That just can’t continue. 

QUESTION:  But what could they do?  I mean, there – these Chinese-controlled or Chinese businesses along the canal, they’re very large ones that could easily be turned into military facilities – do they have to get rid of them?  Do they have to – like, what – what are the kinds of things we could ask for that would satisfy us? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Hong Kong-based companies having control over the entry and exit points of the canal is completely unacceptable.  That cannot continue.  Because of the – and if there’s a conflict and China tells them, do everything you can to obstruct the canal so that the U.S. can’t engage in trade and commerce, so that the U.S. military and naval fleet cannot get to the Indo-Pacific fast enough, they would have to do it.  They would have to do it, and they would do it.  And now we’d have a major problem on our hands.  That’s number one. 

Number two, we have to talk about the fact that we built this thing.  We paid for it.  Thousands of people died doing this – Americans.  And somehow our naval vessels who go through there, and American shipping that goes through there, pays rates some cases higher than other countries are paying – for example, a vessel from China.  That’s also not acceptable.  It was a terrible deal when it was made, it should never have been allowed.  They’re going to tell you that it’s set by an independent administrative entity and not the government; that’s their internal problem.  They’ll have to figure that out.  But we should not be in a position of having to pay more than other countries.  In fact, we should be getting a discount or maybe for free, because we paid for the thing. 

QUESTION:  There too, like you mentioned with Colombia, is there a risk if we play too hardball we drag them into the arms of the Chinese? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, I would argue that the canal is already in the arms of the Chinese.  So I mean, that’s one aspect I would say.  And we can’t operate that way.  Like, we can’t operate in the world saying, well, we can’t defend our national interests because if not these countries will turn to China against us.  I mean, we wouldn’t allow that to happen.  It would be against our national interests.   

So – but that said, I hope we don’t get to that point, right.  We have a – on so many topics, a very good working relationship with Panama and with their government, and I want that to continue.  But we have a core national interest that’s at stake, they should understand that, and I think that they will understand that, and it needs to be addressed.  And we’ll do that; we’ll do it in the right forum.  We’ll do it appropriately.  I’m not here to – we’re not here to embarrass anyone or cause internal friction or problems for them.  But I can assure you if it was the other way around, and that was a canal that the Chinese had built, they would be very forceful about it.  So we can no longer operate in the world with two hands tied behind our back. 

QUESTION:  People need to understand that Panama is not exactly about Panama; it’s about the Chinese, which you’ve been jumping up and down about for a while, warning that people may not realize just how grave the threat is.  And you said something – I think it was at your confirmation hearing – to the effect of if China gets what it wants, in 10 years or so, life could look very different.  Like it could be dramatic —    

SECRETARY RUBIO: Maybe even faster 

QUESTION:  — for us, for America. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  So, I mean they today control – I mean, we love our technology and we need it for all kinds of advances.  All of that depends on critical minerals, at the end of day – ranging aluminum, cobalt – you name it.  They have gone around the world buying up mining rights, and they control not just the mining of it but the refining and the production of it, and the use of it for industrial purposes.  So you might remember during COVID everybody was freaking out because we couldn’t get the masks because they were all made in China.  And then we couldn’t get this because they were all made in China.  We had lost and given away our industrial capacity.  This is even graver.  This is the rare earth minerals, this is the raw materials necessary for some of the things that go into our most advanced technologies in the defense realm, in medicine.  Eighty-something percent of the active ingredients in generic pharmaceuticals in the United States are made in China.  We can’t make them.   

So if they decide we’re going to cut you off from these things, they – we’d be in a lot of trouble, because we gave away our industrial capacity on those things.  That can’t continue.  That’s a vulnerability that we face.  And they will use it as leverage.  In fact, they are already using it as leverage.  For the first time ever, they have actually imposed export controls on critical minerals to damage the – our national security, but ultimately our technological capacity as well. 

So it ranges topics, but ultimately if China controls the means of production for both raw material and industry, then we’re – they have total leverage on us economically.  And that’s the world we’re headed to.  And I was wrong; maybe not in 10 years.  Maybe in five. 

QUESTION:  So I mean, it’s a dicey situation.  Trump – President Trump knows all this. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yes. 

QUESTION:  And yet one of the top Chinese leaders attended his inauguration.  He understands that there’s – it has to be played very carefully.  We don’t want to make an open, hot-war enemy out of them.  But we’ve been passive for too long. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Yeah.  First of all, one of the interesting things about President Trump is he’s incredibly accessible.  People don’t believe this, but I mean, if you’re a – if you’re a rank-and-file, not even leadership, member of Congress and you call the President of the United States, the chances are you’re going to get a call back, and you’re going to get a call back from him, and you might get a call back that very day, maybe within an hour or two.  He’s incredibly accessible, to both Americans and also to foreign leaders.  His policy generally has been, I’ll meet with any world leader, I’ll engage with any world leader.  That doesn’t mean just because you’re meeting with him you’re giving anything away, but he’s willing to engage.   

In the case of China, there’s two things.  I just described one, which is the grave threat that they pose to our national interests; and the other is the mature realization that no matter what happens, China is going to be a rich and powerful country.  We are going to have to deal with them.  In fact – and I said this in my call with their foreign minister, but I said this publicly – the future – the history of the 21st century will largely be about what happened between the U.S. and China.  So for us to pretend that somehow we’re not going to engage with them is absurd. 

Now, we should engage on our national interests.  That doesn’t – engagement and concessions are two different things.  What’s been horrifying is that for 25 or 30 years, we’ve treated China as a developing country, and we allowed them to continue to do things that were unfair.  We said, go ahead, let them cheat on trade, let them steal our technology, because when they get rich they’ll become just like us.  They became rich, they did not become like us, and now they want to continue to have these unfair benefits.  That has to stop. 

QUESTION:  And they built up their military. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Their military, their industrial capacity, but all over the world their control of critical minerals.  Again, I go back to them because people don’t think about it.  

QUESTION:  Buying up land in the United States. 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Buying up farming land in the United States in particular as well, because they need to produce food, and they want to be able to control that.  They’re doing it because it’s in their national interest.  They are doing, frankly, what I would do – well, maybe not the human rights violations, but they are doing what anyone would do if they were the leader of China.  They are acting in China’s best interests.  What’s been missing is American policies that act in our best interest.  And that needs to return. 

QUESTION:  How does Greenland fit into all of this? 

SECRETARY RUBIO:  Well, the Arctic, which has gotten very little attention, but the Arctic Circle and the Arctic region is going to become critical for shipping lanes, for how you get some of this energy that’s going to be produced under President Trump – these energies rely on shipping lanes.  The Arctic has some of the most valuable shipping lanes in the world.  As some of the ice is melting, it’s become more and more navigable.  We need to be able to defend that.   

So if you project what the Chinese have done, it is just a matter of time before – because they are not an Arctic power.  They do not have an Arctic presence, so they need to be able to have somewhere that they can stage from.  And it is completely realistic to believe that the Chinese will eventually – maybe even in the short term – try to do in Greenland what they have done at the Panama Canal and in other places, and that is install facilities that give them access to the Arctic with the cover of a Chinese company but that in reality serve a dual purpose: that in a moment of conflict, they could send naval vessels to that facility and operate from there.  And that is completely unacceptable to the national security of the world and to the United – to the security of the world and the national security of the United States.   

So the question becomes:  If the Chinese begin to threaten Greenland, do we really trust that that is not a place where those deals are going to be made?  Do we really trust that that is not a place where they would not intervene, maybe by force?",USA

200125,Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Fact Sheet,"What Is the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act?

The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) is a U.S. law.  It established a rebuttable presumption that goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China or by an entity on the UFLPA Entity List are subject to import under Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. § 1307).  The law was enacted on December 23, 2021, and enforcement began on June 21, 2022.

What Is the Purpose of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act?

The UFLPA is one tool the U.S. government uses to prevent goods made with forced labor connected to the XUAR from entering the United States and to further promote accountability for entities responsible for forced labor.

What Is the Impact of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act?

The Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for preventing products made with forced labor from entering into the United States by investigating and acting upon allegations of forced labor in supply chains.  CBP has reviewed thousands of shipments from the electronics, apparel, footwear, pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial, and automotive sectors.  This has resulted in the denial of thousands of shipments including goods made with forced labor, totaling hundreds of millions in U.S. dollars.  It also has resulted in companies conducting due diligence measures to ensure compliance with U.S. laws by tracing their supply chains for potential connections to forced labor.  

What Can You Do?

Governments are encouraged to consider similar prohibitions on the import or sale of goods made with forced labor, including broad prohibitions on goods made where state-imposed forced labor is occurring.

Stakeholders in the trade community should closely examine their supply chains to ensure their goods are not mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, with forced labor in the XUAR or elsewhere, or by entities on the UFLPA Entity List.  

Nongovernmental organizations, diaspora communities and activist groups, and private sector entities can raise awareness about the egregious human rights situation in the XUAR.

The UFLPA Entity List includes: (1) a list of entities in XUAR that mine, produce, or manufacture wholly or in part any goods, wares, articles, and merchandise with forced labor; (2) a list of entities working with the government of XUAR to recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, or receive forced labor or Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, or members of other persecuted groups out of XUAR; (3) a list of entities that exported products mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by entities in lists 1 and 2 from the People’s Republic of China into the United States; and (4) a list of facilities and entities, including the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, that source material from XUAR or from persons working with the government of XUAR or the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for purposes of the “poverty alleviation” program or the “pairing-assistance” program or any other government-labor scheme that uses forced labor.",USA

121224,Country Reports on Terrorism 2023: People’s Republic of China (Hong Kong and Macau),"China

Overview:  The PRC’s counterterrorism efforts continued to target ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang as so-called extremists for engaging in standard practices of Islam.  Beijing considers the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) the primary source of terrorism in Xinjiang.  However, there is no credible evidence that ETIM is an extant organization, and the United States instead assesses that it is a broad label the PRC uses to inaccurately paint a variety of Uyghur actors, including non-violent activists and advocates for human rights, as terrorist threats.

The PRC government’s CT measures have included sprawling detention facilities, known officially as “vocational education and training centers,” in which more than one million people are believed to have been detained since 2017.  Since 2014 the PRC has also prosecuted and imprisoned a large number of Xinjiang residents under its “strike hard” campaign against alleged terrorists and “extremists.”  According to PRC law enforcement reporting, prosecutions continued through 2023.  International media reporting indicated that PRC authorities used opaque prosecutions for terrorism offenses as a quasi-legal mechanism to transfer inmates from “reeducation” camps to prisons, allowing the PRC to shut down some of these camps.  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ August 2022 assessment of Xinjiang stated that the PRC’s imprecise definition of “extremism” and overly broad application of its antiterrorism laws led to a “pattern of large-scale arbitrary detention.”  The PRC denies its Xinjiang policies involve human rights abuses, claiming its system of “reeducation” camps exist to “combat separatism and Islamist militancy in the region.”

Since 1999 the PRC has been designated a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.  It was redesignated a CPC in 2023.

2023 Terrorist Incidents:  Terrorist incidents in 2023 in China or that targeted Chinese nationals included the following:

On October 13, in Beijing, a non-PRC citizen stabbed the spouse of an Israeli diplomat working at the Israeli Embassy in Beijing.  The diplomat’s spouse, the only victim in the attack, was seriously injured.  The perpetrator claimed to have targeted the Israeli diplomat because of their nationality.  No group has claimed responsibility for this incident.
On August 13, Chinese engineers were attacked at Gwadar Port in Balochistan, Pakistan.  According to international media reports, the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army claimed credit for the attack.  The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan issued a statement condemning the terrorist act.
Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The PRC continued to advance and defend its counterterrorism policies.  The PRC routinely lobbied foreign partners to extradite alleged extremist Uyghurs and sought public endorsement of its CT efforts in multilateral fora.

Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The PRC is a member of the Financial Action Task Force, the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism.  China’s Financial Intelligence Unit is composed of the PBOC headquarters’ AML Bureau, the China Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Center (or CAMLMAC), PBOC branches’ AML divisions, and the Ministry of Public Security’s local economic crimes bureaus.

In 2021 the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a revised draft anti-money laundering (AML) law for public comment, to prevent and curb money laundering and terrorist financing and to safeguard national security.  According to the State Council’s 2023 legislative workplan, the amended anti-money laundering law was included in a list of 17 draft laws to be reviewed by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.  Updates to the amended AML law reportedly addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets.  As of December 31, the legislation had not been passed.  There were no significant changes in 2023.

Countering Violent Extremism:  The PRC continued to implement broad repressive campaigns in Xinjiang under the guise of countering what it calls “extremism,” including, since 2017, mass “reeducation” and “vocational training” of predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, as well as draconian prison sentences following opaque trials.  Under the pretext of counterterrorism efforts, the PRC used existing domestic laws to actively screen, monitor, and censor its citizens on the internet.

International and Regional Cooperation:  The 2023 China Military Power Report catalogued PRC diplomatic and military outreach in support of its global CT aims, stating that the PRC “is implementing its global counterterrorism strategy through international outreach that spans across diplomatic and military domains to garner the assistance of partner governments to prevent terrorist attacks in China and against Chinese citizens and economic projects abroad.”  The PRC further leveraged involvement in regional security fora, joint border patrols, and international exercises to press its neighbors into adopting its approach to CT operations.

The PRC also continued efforts to promote its Global Security Initiative (GSI) as an alternative approach to pursuing CT cooperation.  In a September 21 speech given at the 13th Ministerial Plenary Meeting of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF), Director of the Chinese Communist Party Central Foreign Affairs Commission and Foreign Minister Wang Yi encouraged the international community to “uphold the GSI’s vision and principles,” adding that “smearing the justified counterterrorism efforts of other countries in the name of human rights, democracy and religion will find no support.”

190924,2024 Fiscal Transparency Report: China,"China

During the review period, the government made its enacted budget and end-of-year report publicly available, including online, but it did not publish an executive budget proposal before enacting the budget. Information on debt obligations was publicly available but was not always complete or updated. Budget documents did not identify financial allocations to or earnings from state-owned enterprises. Not all major state-owned enterprises had publicly available, audited financial statements, and they did not disclose their debt holdings. The supreme audit institution did not meet international standards of independence but reviewed the government’s accounts and made audit reports publicly available within a reasonable period. The government specified in law or regulation, and appeared to follow in practice, the criteria and procedures for awarding natural resource extraction contracts and licenses. Basic information on natural resource extraction awards was publicly available. The sovereign wealth fund had a sound legal framework and disclosed its sources of funding, but not its general approach to withdrawals.

Steps the PRC could take to improve fiscal transparency include:

Providing a substantially complete picture of the government’s revenues and expenditures;
Making its executive budget proposal widely and easily accessible to the public within a reasonable period;
Publishing complete information on debt obligations, including online;
Detailing in budget documents allocations to, earnings from, and debt information of major state-owned enterprises;
Publishing audit reports for major state-owned enterprises;
Ensuring the supreme audit institution meets international standards of independence; and

060824,2024 END Wildlife Trafficking Report,"Report to Congress on the
Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act
P.L. 114-231; 16 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7644

The Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act (P.L. 114-231; 16 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7644) (the Act) directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, to submit to Congress a report that lists Focus Countries and Countries of Concern, as defined in the Act.

Wildlife trafficking remains a serious transnational crime that threatens security, economic prosperity, the rule of law, long-standing conservation efforts, and human health. E.O. 13773 of February 9, 2017 called for a comprehensive and decisive approach to dismantle organized crime syndicates and specifically recognized the connection between wildlife trafficking and transnational criminal organizations.

The Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking (Task Force), co-chaired by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney General, brings together 17 federal departments and agencies to implement the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking (the “National Strategy”). The U.S. government’s three-pronged approach to combating wildlife trafficking – strengthening law enforcement, reducing demand, and building international cooperation – deprives criminals of a key source of financing, reducing the criminal threat posed to U.S. citizens.

The Task Force makes a difference on the ground at home and worldwide to combat wildlife trafficking. Task Force activities are coordinated across the U.S. government: efficiencies are identified and leveraged, redundancies eliminated, and resources used more strategically; international outreach continues to expand; and improved reporting has identified new areas for U.S. engagement. Collaborating with the private sector, local communities, and NGOs, the United States leads the way globally, securing agreements and commitments from governments and stakeholders to take urgent action at all levels. Highlights of Task Force efforts will appear in a separate strategic review, as called for in 16 USC 7631 (d).

Focus Countries

Methodology for Determining Focus Countries

With the 2022 reauthorization of the END Act, the Task Force established a new process for identifying Focus Countries. This process used the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)’s TOC Index, produced with U.S. government support, which is comprised of the most reliable data available on the levels of wildlife trafficking identified in source, transit, or destination countries for trafficked wildlife or wildlife products, and on the countries’ capacities to counter these crimes. The process also evaluated the efficacy of potential U.S. engagement with host governments in such countries to address the scourge of this malign trade. The Task Force then incorporated expert guidance into the process to evaluate information not otherwise accounted for, for example, from U.S. federal law enforcement analyses, embassy reporting on wildlife trafficking, NGO advisories, and available intelligence reports.

U.S. embassies supplied specific data, where available, on wildlife trafficking investigations, prosecutions, and punishments; campaigns to reduce demand for illegally sourced wildlife and wildlife products and to raise awareness about wildlife trafficking; and assessments of legal frameworks within each country purporting to address the problem adequately, among other indicators. These indicators measure inputs, outputs, or outcomes of law enforcement capacity building and cooperation efforts; the extent of any policy reform; and tailored demand reduction actions. They also measure how serious wildlife crime is perceived in each country.

U.S. missions in all 24 Focus Countries reported indicator data this year. Every post reported supporting host country wildlife law enforcement with training or other resources in the last two years. Twenty-one of 24 posts reported data on arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of wildlife traffickers. Eighteen posts reported existing laws treating wildlife trafficking as a serious crime. The Task Force also obtained data on demand reduction indicators for 11 of the 24 Focus Countries, reaching an estimated 197 million people.

The Task Force further evaluated whether governments had recently taken steps to improve legislation, regulations, and/or enforcement of their national laws, as well as evaluated other trends that might suggest that a country is increasing its efforts to combat illegal trade in wildlife.

2024 Focus Countries

The Department of State, in consultation with the Departments of the Interior and Commerce as required by the END Act, as well as the Department of Justice and USAID, determined 22 of the previous 28 countries and jurisdictions listed as Focus Countries in the 2021 END Act Report should remain listed. Each of those 22 countries continue as a “major source of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, a major transit point of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, or a major consumer of wildlife trafficking products.” The six countries that did not carry over from the 2021 END Act Report to this report fell off for several reasons. Hong Kong dropped because the Task Force no longer considered it sufficiently independent from the PRC to merit a separate inclusion. The remaining countries, Bangladesh, Burma, Malaysia, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates, fell off either due to the new methodology the Task Force used to identify Focus Countries, pursuant to the 2022 reauthorization of the END Act, or present separate challenges to implementation of U.S. activities. The Department of State further determined, again in consultation with these agencies, two additional countries should be designated as Focus Countries.

This determination is based on analysis of the statutory criteria in the Act and does not reflect a positive or negative judgment of the listed countries or indicate these countries are not working diligently to combat wildlife trafficking. Indeed, the United States has longstanding partnerships with many of these countries with respect to combating wildlife trafficking and recognizes strong political will already exists in many of these countries to tackle this problem. The Department and other Task Force agencies look forward to continuing close and constructive relationships with these countries as we collaborate to combat wildlife trafficking.

Consistent with 16 USC 7631, U.S. missions in each Focus Country will revise their strategic plans based on the respective mission’s assessment of wildlife trafficking within that country. U.S. agencies will use the strategic plans to guide and coordinate U.S. approaches and responses to the needs and gaps identified in the assessment. The Task Force co-chairs, along with USAID, have previously developed and distributed templates for both the assessments and strategic plans. All Task Force agencies, both at post and at agency headquarters, were invited to contribute to their development. The Task Force will review the updated assessments and strategic plans for completeness and consistency, recognizing variability based on location, resources within the U.S. mission, and previous engagement on the issue.

Together these documents will provide an overview of the issues related to wildlife trafficking in each country, identify key areas for strategic intervention by the U.S. government, and either establish a new platform or support existing structures within the mission to guide a coordinated, “whole of government” approach to interventions.

Countries of Concern

To identify Countries of Concern among the 24 Focus Countries as defined under 16 USC 7601 (5), the Department of State, in consultation with the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, as well as with the Department of Justice and USAID, reviewed publicly available information as well as classified material to identify governments actively engaged in or knowingly profiting from trafficking of endangered or threatened species. The Department of State designated the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Laos, and Madagascar as Countries of Concern in the first three END Act reports, 2017-19. In 2020, Cambodia, Cameroon, and Nigeria were added. There were no changes in 2021. For 2024, Task Force agencies spent considerable time reviewing the criteria that had led to the earlier designations, and the new, expanded scope of that designation under 16 USC 7601 (4)(B), and ultimately decided on no changes. The Country of Concern designation does not indicate that all parts of a government are or have been involved in wildlife trafficking, but it does indicate serious concerns either high-level or systemic government involvement has occurred. The Task Force will, among other things, ensure U.S. government agencies coordinate among themselves and with non-federal partners to implement the respective U.S. mission strategic plans developed in accordance with 16 USC 7631 (a)(2) of the Act, with a view to supporting these countries and their governments’ efforts to reduce trade in, and consumer demand for, illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products.

The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), as well as other laws and policies, states that residents have freedom of conscience, freedom of religious belief, and freedom to preach, conduct, and participate in religious activities in public. The Bill of Rights Ordinance incorporates the religious freedom protections of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In 2020, the central government imposed a broad National Security Law (NSL) on Hong Kong with the stated aim of combating secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign powers.

The nongovernmental organization (NGO) Freedom House reported religious freedom was generally respected in Hong Kong, but the organization downgraded Hong Kong’s freedom of expression and belief rating during the year “due to evidence that the broader crackdown on dissent has prompted some churches to self-censor sermons and curtail other religious activities.” According to the report, Falun Gong adherents were free to practice in public but faced counterdemonstrations and harassment by groups with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. At year’s end, the trial of Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former Catholic Bishop of Hong Kong and an outspoken defender of civil rights in the SAR and mainland China, on suspicion of “collusion with foreign forces” remained pending. In March, the Hong Kong Taoist Association canceled a scheduled parade to celebrate “Taoist Day” in favor of a small, private event after police did not approve organizers’ request to hold the march. At a conference of Protestant leaders in April, participants said government retaliation for religious groups’ participation in social movements, the COVID-19 pandemic, the NSL, and emigration from Hong Kong since 2020 adversely affected local churches. According to a November report from the NGO Hong Kong Watch, some religious leaders said religious schools in the SAR, under pressure from the Hong Kong government, were “diluting religious education” due to new NSL and “patriotic” education mandates.

In April, Stephen Chow, Roman Catholic Bishop of Hong Kong, met with Roman Catholic Bishop of Beijing Joseph Li Shan in Beijing and wrote afterwards in the Hong Kong diocese’s official publication that the catechism states “the duty of the citizen is to cooperate with the government and to contribute to the welfare of society in an atmosphere of truth, justice, joint responsibility and freedom.” Chow’s comments drew mixed reactions. The Catholic News Agency for Asia published an opinion piece stating Chow’s visit to Beijing reflected the suppression of religious freedom in Hong Kong, but the Christian Times cited a Hong Kong Baptist University scholar saying that Chow’s remarks merely affirmed the Catholic Church’s view of patriotism as loving “the people who live in this country” rather than love for specific “political groups.” In November, Bishop Li of Beijing, president of the government-affiliated Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), attended a theological conference in Hong Kong. According to media reports, at the conference, Li promoted the “Sinicization” of faith and stressed the need to more closely combine Catholic faith and Chinese culture.

Religious leaders reported hosting and participating in interfaith activities, some of which the religious groups characterized as patriotic. Amid controversy among their members about separation of church and state, the Buddhist Association, Anglican Church, and Muslim community flew People’s Republic of China (PRC) flags in September and October to celebrate PRC National Day, and religious leaders made statements about the role of religion in supporting the government and promoting patriotism and national prosperity. Observers reported Christian churches in Hong Kong continued to provide spiritual and monetary support to underground churches in mainland China.

The U.S. Consul General and consular staff regularly met with a range of government officials managing religious affairs to obtain more information on government policies and advocate for greater religious freedom and tolerance. U.S. officials repeatedly raised concerns regarding the arrest of religious figures and the shrinking space for civil society, including religious groups, during meetings with official counterparts, religious leaders, NGOs, and community representatives, as well as in public messages. Throughout the year, U.S. officials attended religious events and organized public outreach events to promote religious freedom and tolerance.

Section I.
Religious Demography

The U.S. government estimates the total population at 7.3 million (midyear 2023). According to SAR government statistics from July 2022, there are more than one million followers of Taoism and more than one million followers of Buddhism; 480,000 Protestants; 379,000 Catholics; 300,000 Muslims; 100,000 Hindus; and 12,000 Sikhs. The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, which recognizes the Pope and maintains links to the Vatican, reported approximately 593,000 followers (395,000 citizens and 198,000 residents of other nationalities). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported it has approximately 25,100 members. According to the World Jewish Congress, there are approximately 2,500 Jews, primarily expatriates. Small communities of Baha’is and Zoroastrians also reside in the SAR. Confucianism is widespread, and, in some cases, elements of Confucianism are practiced in conjunction with other belief systems. The Falun Dafa Association estimates there are approximately 500 Falun Gong practitioners. There are numerous Protestant denominations, including Baptist, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican, the Church of Christ in China, Seventh-day Adventist, and Pentecostal groups.

Section II.
Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom

Legal Framework

The Basic Law states residents have freedom of conscience, freedom of religious belief, and freedom to preach, to conduct, and participate in religious activities in public. The Basic Law also states the government may not interfere in the internal affairs of religious organizations or restrict religious activities that do not contravene other laws. The Basic Law calls for ties between the region’s religious groups and their counterparts in mainland China based on “nonsubordination, noninterference, and mutual respect.” The Basic Law states that religious organizations “may maintain and develop their relations with religious organizations and believers elsewhere.”

The Bill of Rights Ordinance incorporates the religious freedom protections of the ICCPR, which include the right to manifest religious belief individually or in community with others, in public or private, and through worship, observance, practice, and teaching. The ordinance states persons belonging to ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities have the right to enjoy their own culture, profess and practice their own religion, and use their own language. The ordinance also protects the right of parents or legal guardians to “ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.” These rights may be limited when an emergency is proclaimed, and the “manifestation” of religious beliefs may be limited by law when necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals, or the rights of others. If a state of emergency is proclaimed, the rights may not be limited based solely on religion.

The NSL prohibits secession, subversion, terrorism, and “collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.” The law states that it shall override local laws if there are inconsistencies. The NSL states power to interpret the law lies with the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, not with local courts.

Religious groups are not legally required to register with the government. They must, however, register to receive government benefits such as tax-exempt status, rent subsidies, government or other professional development training, use of government facilities, or a grant to provide social services. To qualify for such benefits, a group must prove to the satisfaction of the government that it is established solely for religious, charitable, social, or recreational reasons. Registrants must provide the name and purpose of the organization, identify its office holders, and confirm the address of the principal place of business and any other premises the organization owns or occupies. If a religious group registers with the government, it enters the registry of all NGOs, but the government makes no adjudication on the validity of any registered groups. Religious groups may register as a society, a tax-exempt organization, or both, provided they have at least three members who hold valid SAR identity documents; the registration process normally takes approximately 12 working days. The Falun Dafa Association is registered as a society rather than a religious group; as a society, it may establish offices, collect dues from members, and have legal status.

Government tax regulations provide that any group, including religious groups, involved in activities deemed to endanger national security would not be recognized as a charitable organization.

The Basic Law allows private schools to provide religious education. A small percentage of government-funded schools are government-run; most government-funded schools are operated by religious groups, with the remainder operated by nonreligious charitable organizations. Government-subsidized schools must adhere to government curriculum standards and may not bar students based on religion, but they may provide nonmandatory religious instruction as part of their curriculum. Teachers may not discriminate against students because of their religious beliefs. The government curriculum mandates coursework on ethics and religious studies, with a focus on religious tolerance; it also includes elective modules on world religions.

The NSL stipulates the SAR “shall take necessary measures to strengthen public communication, guidance, supervision and regulation over matters concerning national security, including those relating to schools, universities, social organizations, the media, and the internet.” All schools following the Education Bureau curriculum, including private institutions and those run by religious groups, must incorporate lessons on “national security” into the curriculum, beginning at the kindergarten level. Private and international schools that do not receive funding from SAR authorities, including those run by religious groups, are not required to follow the guidelines, but the guidelines state that these schools have the “responsibility to help their students … acquire a correct and objective understanding and apprehension of the concept of national security and the National Security Law.”

Religious groups may apply to the government to lease land on concessional terms through a sponsorship from the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau. Religious groups may apply to develop or use facilities in accordance with local legislation.

The Chinese Temples Committee, led by the Secretary of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, oversees the management and logistical operations of 24 of the region’s 600 temples and gives grants to other charitable organizations. The SAR Chief Executive appoints its members. The committee provides grants to the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau for disbursement in the form of financial assistance to individuals in need. A colonial-era law does not require new temples to register to be eligible for Temples Committee assistance.

The Chief Executive Election Committee (CEEC) is composed of 1,500 members drawn from five sectors, divided into 40 subsectors, representing various trades, professions, and social services groups. The religious subsector, under the third sector (“Grassroots, labor, religious, and other”), is composed of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong, Chinese Muslim Cultural and Fraternal Association, Hong Kong Christian Council, Hong Kong Taoist Association, Confucian Academy, and Hong Kong Buddhist Association. These six bodies are each entitled to 10 of the 60 seats of the religious subsector on the CEEC. The religious subsector is not required to hold elections under the Chief Executive Election Ordinance. Instead, each religious organization selects its electors according to its own rules. Each of the six designated religious groups is also a member of the Hong Kong Colloquium of Religious Leaders.

Government Practices

As of year’s end, the trial of 91-year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen on charges that he violated the NSL by “colluding with foreign forces” remained pending. Zen, the former Bishop of Hong Kong and an outspoken defender of civil rights in the SAR and mainland China, remained free on bail, following his arrest in December 2022. Zen had to surrender his travel documents, including his passport, to Hong Kong authorities as a condition of his bail; however, in January, the Hong Kong government allowed Zen to travel to the Vatican to attend the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, and media reported he met privately with Pope Francis.

Media outlets reported that on March 20, a court sentenced Alan Keung, founder of independent media outlet Free HK Media and known as “Pastor Keung,” and two others to 10 months in prison for selling a “seditious book” that discussed the 2019 prodemocracy protests.

In its Freedom in the World 2023 report, the NGO Freedom House stated that religious freedom was generally respected in Hong Kong, but the organization downgraded Hong Kong’s freedom of expression and belief rating from 4/4 in 2022 to 3/4 in 2023 “due to evidence that the broader crackdown on dissent has prompted some churches to self-censor sermons and other religious activities.” According to the report, Falun Gong adherents were free to practice in public but faced counterdemonstrations and harassment by groups with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. In an interview with the Catholic Reporter in November, Benedict Rogers, chief executive of the UK-based rights NGO Hong Kong Watch, said, “It’s fair to say … that freedom of worship, narrowly defined, is still intact. People in Hong Kong are still free to go to church, to the mosque, to the temple or the synagogue, to go to places of worship, and to access sacred scriptures and religious texts and literature.” He added, however, “It’s almost impossible to find clergy who will preach in their sermons on anything relating, explicitly or implicitly, to human rights, human dignity, freedom or justice. This essentially means co-option, coercion and corruption of religion.”

Vision Times reported that on April 21, a court sentenced Hu Aimin and Chow Wing-lam to 15 weeks and nine weeks in prison, respectively, for vandalizing six Falun Gong information booths in 2021. On April 3, a court acquitted a third defendant in the case, Zhou Jinshen, due to insufficient evidence.

Local media reported that in March, the Hong Kong Taoist Association canceled a scheduled parade to celebrate “Taoist Day.” Organizers instead held a religious assembly open only to members in a small soccer field in Kowloon. The association said it had expected approximately 1,600 persons to take part in the parade. An organizer told media outlets the group moved the event because police did not approve organizers’ request to hold the march, but police officials did not reply to media inquiries about whether they objected to the demonstration. Government officials and legislative council members attended the stadium rally.

The local outlet Christian Times reported that on April 17, the Jiandao Theological Seminary held a conference on “Shaping the Future of the Church in Hong Kong.” At the conference, which brought together more than 740 pastors, lay leaders, and seminarians, the heads of Hong Kong’s three largest Protestant denominational coalitions – the China Christian Evangelistic Association, Hong Kong Baptist Convention, and Hong Kong Federation of Chistian and Missionary Alliances – called for church leaders to display flexibility in the face of dwindling numbers and government pressure. Participants said government retaliation for religious groups’ participation in social movements, the COVID-19 pandemic, the NSL, and emigration from Hong Kong since 2020 all adversely affected local churches. According to the dean of Jiandao Theological Seminary, Cai Shaoqi, in recent years, the overall number of worshippers had dropped by 15 to 25 percent, while donations dropped 10 to 20 percent, and the number of pastors dropped 5 to 10 percent. In a closed-door meeting, leaders of seven different denominations discussed the challenges churches faced under the NSL and the need to cooperate with the Hong Kong Education Bureau.

The Christian Times reported that at the April 17 conference, Fan Kwok Kwong, general secretary of the Hong Kong Federation of Christian and Missionary Alliances, said that after two years of discussions with authorities over government concerns about the group allowing prodemocracy protestors to rest inside its church in 2019, authorities permitted it to continue holding meetings in the church. Fan said the Liaison Office of the Central People’s Government, which represents the central government in Hong Kong, was actively communicating with federation leaders, and he reported that some local political leaders had blocked religious figures active in the 2019 prodemocracy movement from applying for new projects.

In April, shortly after the government lifted the COVID-19 mask mandate, media reported that some Catholics expressed concern about new police rules regarding participation in a march to mark Palm Sunday, including requirements that all marchers must wear a red ribbon and carry a palm branch. The media report also said the police did not permit marchers to wear masks. Police said the rule was in place to ensure participants did not use facial coverings to avoid being identified.

In June, the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong for the second consecutive year did not hold memorial masses on June 4 to honor the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. In 2022, the diocese’s Justice and Peace Commission, which had organized the masses for more than three decades, cited concern that the masses could violate the NSL.

A November report from Hong Kong Watch highlighted some Hong Kong religious leaders’ concerns that since the NSL went into effect, religious schools in Hong Kong, under pressure from the Hong Kong government, were “diluting religious education” due to new NSL and “patriotic” education mandates. Some Protestant Christian leaders also voiced concern about new difficulties reserving space in public schools for church activities, according to the report.

Section III.
Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom

Religious groups, some of which received government funding, provided a wide range of social services open to individuals regardless of religious affiliation, including welfare, elder care, hospitals, publishing services, employment services, rehabilitation centers, youth and community service functions, and other charitable activities. SAR officials reportedly attended some of those activities to show the government’s support for those religious groups.

According to an August telephone survey of Hong Kong residents by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, more than 500 responded and rated the degree of religious freedom in the SAR on average as 7.34 out of 10, compared with an average of 7.30 a year earlier.

Catholic media reported that in April, Stephen Chow, Bishop of Hong Kong, the most senior Catholic cleric in Hong Kong, who became a cardinal in September, and several senior priests went to Beijing, at the invitation of Bishop of Beijing Joseph Li Shan; this marked the first visit of a Hong Kong bishop to Beijing in nearly 30 years. In a press statement prior to the visit, Chow said he hoped to “promote exchanges and interactions” between the mainland and the broader Catholic Church in Asia. Following the visit to Beijing, Chow wrote in the diocese’s official publication Kung Kao Po that “patriotism is part of the Catholic Church’s teaching.” He said the catechism states “the duty of the citizen is to cooperate with the government and to contribute to the welfare of society in an atmosphere of truth, justice, joint responsibility and freedom,” and that “citizens are called to do their duty in the life of the political community.” Chow said he expected there would be opportunities for dialogue between the government and the Catholic Church, and that people should “help the government to become better for the sake of the country.” Separately, Chow told media that the Hong Kong church had a mission to be a “bridging church” between the West and China. In a May interview with the Italian Jesuit publication La Civilta Cattolica, Chow said, “According to one of the government officials whom we met during the trip, Sinicization is similar to our concept of inculturation.” He called for more dialogue with the mainland Catholic Church on the issue. Chow’s comments drew mixed reactions. The Catholic News Agency for Asia published an opinion piece stating Chow’s visit to Beijing reflected the suppression of religious freedom in Hong Kong, but the Christian Times cited a Hong Kong Baptist University scholar saying that Chow’s remarks merely affirmed the Catholic Church’s view of patriotism as loving “the people who live in this country” rather than love for specific “political groups.”

In November, Bishop Li, president of the government-affiliated CCPA, paid a reciprocal visit to Hong Kong, reportedly to strengthen ties between the two dioceses, and participated in a theological conference. According to media reports, Li promoted the Sinicization of faith and stressed the need to more closely combine Catholic faith and Chinese culture. Cardinal Chow also participated in the conference.

Religious leaders continued to participate in interfaith activities, some of which the groups characterized as patriotic. Several religious groups held ceremonies in September and October to mark the 74th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. On September 19, Buddhist, Catholic, Confucian, Muslim, Christian, and Taoist religious leaders and representatives of the local government and the central government’s liaison office attended a conference in Kowloon to celebrate the anniversary. In their speeches, religious leaders said the religious community had a role to play in promoting national prosperity.

Media reported that on September 28, the Buddhist Association held its first ever flag-raising ceremony for PRC National Day at a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong. Taking place at the Po Lin Monastery on Lantau Island, Yin Zonghua, deputy director of the central government’s liaison office, was the officiating guest of honor; Master Kuan Yun, president of the Hong Kong Buddhist Federation, and Leung Wang-ching, deputy director of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau also attended. Monks offered prayers for the “prosperity and stability of the motherland.” Master Kuan Yun said the Buddhist community had always advocated patriotism, abiding by the law, loyalty to the country, and supporting the policies of the central and SAR governments.

Local media reported that on October 1, St John’s Anglican Cathedral, Hong Kong’s oldest church, displayed for the first time the PRC national flag during a service to commemorate PRC National Day and pray for the country. The move was reportedly suggested by lawmaker and Reverend Peter Koon, who was elected as a member of the city’s “patriot-only” legislature in December 2021. Koon dismissed online criticism of the decision to fly the PRC flag in the church, saying it stemmed from a “misunderstanding of our country” and that the Anglican Church had never separated the church and the state. Koon said the national flag would be displayed at National Day services in the future.

Radio Free Asia reported that in June, the Kowloon Mosque flew the PRC flag to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC. In October, the mosque flew the PRC flag to celebrate PRC National Day. PRC and Hong Kong government officials attended these events, which featured the PRC national anthem and members of the Muslim community marching in military style. Representatives of the liaison office, senior government and police officials, senior Muslim leaders, and personnel from the consulates general of Egypt, Pakistan, and Qatar in Hong Kong also attended. The organizers stressed that the raising of the PRC flag at the mosque was in compliance with China’s religious guidelines of “patriotism and love of religion” and “Sinicization of Islam.” According to media outlets, the Muslim community was divided on the issue, with some community members calling the raising of the flag “a normal thing,” while others expressed concern, calling it a “blasphemy.”

Observers reported that Christian churches in Hong Kong continued to provide underground churches in mainland China with spiritual and monetary support, including Bibles and Christian literature and visits from church members. Some Hong Kong churches reported that they were able to conduct cross-border online services, while others, including the Catholic Church, reported PRC authorities prohibited individuals in mainland China from attending their online services.

Section IV.
U.S. Government Policy and Engagement

The U.S. Consul General and consular staff repeatedly raised concerns regarding the arrest of religious figures and the shrinking space for civil society, including religious groups, during meetings with a range of official counterparts. In these meetings, consulate general officials, including the Consul General, stressed the importance of religious pluralism, tolerance, and the role religious groups played in addressing social issues.

Consulate general officials, including the Consul General, also continued to meet with a wide range of religious organizations, including Buddhist, Catholic, Taoist, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, and Protestant religious leaders and adherents to emphasize the importance of religious freedom and tolerance and to receive reports regarding the status of religious freedom both in Hong Kong and in mainland China. They also met with NGOs and community representatives regarding the same topics.

During the year, the consulate conducted outreach to religious communities and the broader public that promoted religious pluralism and tolerance. On May 20, the consulate organized a cultural event for 60 members of the general public at the Khalsa Diwan Sikh Temple in Hong Kong, where two diplomats discussed their Asian American heritage and shared their thoughts on cultural diversity, while members of the temple talked about the history and community role of Sikhism. In November, the consulate sponsored, promoted, and delivered opening remarks at the screenings of two American films at the 24th annual Jewish Film Festival in Hong Kong, including one focused on the history of antisemitism. In connection with the festival, the Consul General and members of other diplomatic missions and civil society groups attended a Shabbat dinner hosted by the Jewish community.

In October, the consulate hosted a three-day visit by a Catholic University professor and consultant to the Holy See Mission to the United Nations, who met with members of academia, civil society, and the religious community in Hong Kong to discuss conflict, reconciliation, and strategic peacebuilding. The consulate convened an interfaith roundtable with Jewish, Sikh, Muslim, and Christian faith leaders, academics, and the visiting professor to discuss religious freedom. The professor also delivered lectures for professors and students of religious education, met with high school teachers and NGOs to discuss peacebuilding, and trained social workers from a religious organization on reconciliation work",USA
260624,"China (Includes Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet, and Xinjiang): Macau","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Basic Law of the Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) grants residents freedom of religious belief, freedom to preach and participate in religious activities in public, and freedom to pursue religious education. These rights may be limited in extraordinary situations for national security reasons. The law protects the right of religious assembly and stipulates religious groups may develop and maintain relations with religious groups abroad. Under the Basic Law, the SAR government, rather than the central government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), safeguards religious freedom in the SAR. Bylaws to the National Security Law (NSL) give the local Judiciary Police investigative authority over religious groups and personnel.

Most religious groups in the SAR maintained close ties with the PRC government. According to a government report, senior government officials regularly consulted with religious leaders as part of a Beijing-led strategy to foster greater regional religious and cultural exchange within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. Some religious activists in the diaspora called on the PRC government to allow greater religious expression in the SAR, as provided for by the Basic Law. One former legislator said police prohibited Falun Gong adherents from setting up information stalls at the Ruins of St. Paul’s, claiming they obstructed pedestrian movement.

The Catholic Church in Macau continued to recognize the Pope as its head, and the Holy See appointed the bishop of the diocese. Despite some restrictions, Falun Gong practitioners reported they generally continued to be able to discuss their beliefs openly with Macau residents. Some media reports portrayed Falun Gong members negatively.

In exchanges with SAR government officials, civil society representatives, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), representatives from the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong and Macau stressed the importance of religious diversity and religious freedom and discussed religious communities’ relations with their coreligionists on the mainland and in Hong Kong. In June, the Consul General visited multiple religious sites in Macau and met with a local Catholic charity.

Section I.
Religious Demography

The U.S. government estimates the total population of Macau at 640,000 (midyear 2023). According to a 2022 estimate by the research group Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA), as of 2020, 58.7 percent of the population are folk religionists, 17.3 percent Buddhist, 4.9 percent Catholic, 1.6 percent Protestant, 15.8 percent nonreligious, and less than 2 percent other religious groups, including other Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Taoists, and Jews.

The SAR Government Information Bureau 2023 yearbook states a majority of the population practices Buddhism or Chinese folk religions. The yearbook does not provide an estimate for Buddhists, but it states they are numerous, and individuals often practice a mixture of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Chinese folk religions. The SAR Government Information Bureau estimates 5 percent of the population is Catholic (approximately 32,400), of whom almost half are foreign domestic workers and other expatriates, and 1.2 percent of the population are Protestant (approximately 8,000). Protestant denominations include Church of the United Brethren, Church of Christ in China, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Assemblies of God, Baptists, and Anglicans. Evangelical Christian and independent local nondenominational churches, some of which are affiliated with officially recognized mainland churches, are also present. ARDA estimates the Muslim population at 1,300, the majority of whom are Sunni. Smaller religious groups include Baha’is; ARDA approximates their membership at 200. Falun Gong practitioners estimate their numbers at 20 to 50 persons.

Section II.
Status of Government Respect for Religious Freedom

Legal Framework

The Basic Law states residents have freedom of religious belief and the freedom to publicly preach, as well as to conduct and participate in religious activities. These rights may be limited in extraordinary situations for national security reasons. The Basic Law further stipulates the government shall not interfere in the internal affairs of religious groups or in their relations with their counterparts outside Macau. It bars the government from restricting religious activities that do not contravene the laws of the SAR.

Under the Basic Law, the SAR government, rather than the central government of the PRC, safeguards religious freedom in the SAR.

The law states there is no official religion in the SAR and stipulates all religious denominations are equal before the law. The law provides for freedom of religion, including privacy of religious belief, freedom of religious assembly, freedom to hold religious processions, and freedom of religious education. Under the SAR’s NSL bylaws, the Judiciary Police has four national security branches that have investigative authority over religious groups and personnel, among others: the National Security Information Division; the National Security Crime Investigation Division; the National Security Action Support Division; and the National Security Affairs Integrated Service Division.

Religious groups are not required to register to conduct religious activities, but registration enables them to benefit from legal status. Benefits include exemption from taxation (such as property tax, stamp duty, complementary tax [profit tax], and industrial tax) and receiving financial assistance from the government. Religious groups who choose to register must do so with the Identification Bureau, providing the name of an individual applicant and that person’s position in the group, identification card number, and contact information, as well as the group’s name and a copy of the group’s charter. Registered charities receive the same benefits as registered religious groups. Religious groups need to be registered separately as a charity under a different name in order to provide charitable services.

The law states that religious organizations may run seminaries and schools, hospitals, and welfare institutions, and provide other social services.

There is no religious education in public schools. A small number of schools operated by religious organizations receive no public funding, and these schools may require students to receive religious education.

By law, religious groups may develop and maintain relations with religious groups abroad.

Government Practices

Most religious groups in the SAR maintained close ties with the central government. During the year, multiple provincial government delegations from the mainland met with local religious leaders during visits to the SAR. The SAR government reported it had a long-standing relationship with local religious communities. According to a government report issued in January, senior officials regularly consulted with religious leaders as part of a Beijing-led strategy to foster greater regional religious and cultural exchange within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area. Under this initiative, the Buddhist federations of Guangdong Province, Hong Kong, and Macau, with support from the Macau Foundation and the SAR’s Cultural Affairs Bureau, held a Buddhist Puja in Macau in December 2022 to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the transfer of sovereignty over Macau to the PRC.

Some religious activists in the diaspora called on the PRC government to allow greater religious expression in the SAR, as provided for by the Basic Law. A former lawmaker said that although in prior years Falun Gong practitioners had been tacitly allowed to set up promotion stalls at the city’s landmark Ruins of St. Paul’s, after 2022, police refused to approve their stalls saying the stalls obstructed pedestrian movement.

Some religious groups continued to report they retained their ability to conduct charitable activities on the mainland by working through official channels and officially recognized churches.

The government continued to provide financial support to a variety of religious groups to establish schools, child-care centers, clinics, homes for the elderly, rehabilitation centers, and vocational training centers. The government also continued to refer victims of human trafficking to religious organizations for the provision of support services.

On January 9, at a meeting with representatives of several religious groups, Chief Executive Ho Lat Seng said the government had always respected diverse religious beliefs and that residents enjoyed freedom of religion. Ho praised religious groups’ activities to “help residents tide over the difficult times,” including the COVID-19 pandemic, and said he and hoped they would continue “to uphold the spirit of doing good and convey positive messages to the general population, especially the young people of Macau.”

Section III.
Status of Societal Respect for Religious Freedom

The Catholic Church in Macau continued to recognize the Pope as its head. The Holy See appointed the bishop for the diocese. The Catholic Diocese of Macau continued to run many educational institutions, either directly or through other Catholic groups, including approximately one-third of the 64 private primary and secondary schools.

Despite some restrictions, Falun Gong practitioners reported they generally continued to be able to discuss their beliefs openly with Macau residents. Some media reports portrayed Falun Gong members negatively.

Section IV.
U.S. Government Policy and Engagement

The U.S. government was represented in Macau by the U.S. Consulate General, Hong Kong and Macau, located in Hong Kong. In exchanges with SAR government officials, civil society representatives, and NGOs, representatives from the U.S. Consulate General Hong Kong and Macau, including the Consul General, stressed the importance of religious diversity and religious freedom and discussed religious communities’ relations with their coreligionists on the mainland and in Hong Kong.

070624,Report to Congress on Access to Tibetan Areas – Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 (8 U.S.C. 1182 note),"Executive Summary

This is the sixth annual report under Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 (8 U.S.C. 1182 note), enacted December 19, 2018, which requires the Department of State to provide a report to Congress, within 90 days of enactment and annually thereafter for five years, regarding the level of access People’s Republic of China (PRC) authorities granted to U.S. diplomats and officials, journalists, and tourists to the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas in China, including a comparison with the level of access granted to other areas of China; a comparison between the levels of access to Tibetan and non-Tibetan areas in relevant provinces; a comparison of the level of access compared to the previous reporting year; and a description of the required permits and other measures that impede travel in Tibetan areas. This report covers 2023, with comparisons to 2022, as applicable.

The outbreak of COVID-19 in January 2020 led to country-wide restrictions on travel within China and entry to China, which impacted the ability of foreign diplomats, journalists, and tourists to travel to the TAR and other Tibetan areas. Domestic COVID-19 controls were lifted in late 2022, including as regards travel to the TAR.

However, PRC government regulations and procedures that have historically impeded travel to the TAR and Tibetan areas outside the TAR for U.S. diplomats and officials, journalists, and tourists remained in place in 2023. International visitors’ travel to the TAR continued to require the approval of TAR government travel permits. In 2023, U.S. officials made three requests for official travel to the TAR, none of which were approved. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, U.S. officials made no requests to visit the TAR in 2022; one request was made in 2021, which the TAR government denied. For diplomats and officials, travel to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR did not require a permit or special notification beyond the requirements in place for other parts of China. PRC security forces have used conspicuous surveillance to intimidate, monitor, harass, and restrict the movements of U.S. diplomats, officials, and foreigners, including while on personal travel to Tibetan areas. Tibetan Americans regularly have faced restrictions on their travel to Tibetan areas, although anecdotal reports suggest Tibetan Americans had more access to the TAR than in 2022. Access to these areas for journalists remained restricted and limited.

Impact of the Suspension of Operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu

Due to the PRC government’s withdrawal of consent for operation in retaliation to the United States’ withdrawal of consent for the operation of PRC Consulate General Houston, the United States suspended operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu (CG Chengdu) on July 27, 2020. The suspension of operations at CG Chengdu resulted in Embassy Beijing taking responsibility for coverage of the TAR and Tibetan areas more than 800 miles away from Beijing. This has severely inhibited the U.S. Mission’s ability to maintain access to Tibetan areas.

Differences in Access to Tibet Autonomous Region and Tibetan Areas

While China maintains clear and strict access requirements for travel to the TAR, access requirements to travel to sensitive Tibetan areas in other provinces remained ambiguous. Tibetan areas, which are prefectures and counties containing historic and current Tibetan populations outside of the TAR, exist in Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces. Municipal and prefecture-level PRC and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials are often responsible for access restrictions to these areas, resulting in differing conditions and making it difficult to determine the rationale and timing for these restrictions.

Comparison with the Level of Access Granted to the Tibetan and Non-Tibetan Areas of China

Diplomats and other officials

In 2023, the TAR continued to be the only area of China that PRC authorities required diplomats and other foreign officials to formally request permission to visit. Diplomats could not purchase air or train tickets to enter the TAR without official approval.

Diplomats and other foreign officials did not face additional formal restrictions on travel to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR; however, PRC officials sometimes used conspicuous surveillance to intimidate, monitor, harass, and restrict travel to these areas.

During the reporting year, the U.S. mission personnel were unable to conduct any American Citizen Services visits to the TAR in 2023 because requests for visits by consular officers were not approved. No consular officer has visited the TAR since 2019. In previous years, local officials in the TAR had been responsive to consular requests to provide assistance to U.S. citizens but occasionally delayed their response on emergency access requests made by U.S. consular officers.

Tourists

PRC government regulations controlled travel of international visitors to the TAR for tourism, a restriction applied by no other provincial-level entity in China. In accordance with a 1989 central government regulation, international visitors, including U.S. citizens, were required to obtain an official confirmation letter issued by the TAR government, which reports to the central government in Beijing, before entering the TAR. Most tourists received such letters by booking tours through travel agencies officially registered with the PRC government. The PRC government mandated a designated tour guide accompany international tourists while in the TAR. Foreigners rarely obtained permission to enter the TAR by road. Authorities denied access to the TAR for many international tourists during periods the PRC government considered politically sensitive, including the March anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan Uprising against China’s invasion of Tibet and the Dalai Lama’s birthday in July.

The TAR Tourism Bureau reported that from January to June 2022, TAR received over 17 million tourists. In 2019 CG Chengdu estimated roughly 10,000 U.S. citizens visited the region. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, U.S. Embassy Beijing believes the number of U.S. citizens who visited the TAR to have decreased substantially in 2020-2022. It is not known how many U.S. citizens visited the TAR in 2023, but numbers likely fall far short of those seen in 2019.

Tibetan Americans undergo a stricter screening process than other U.S. citizens when applying for PRC visas at PRC embassies. Their applications are processed through the United Front Work Department (UFWD), often require a letter from a relative or host in the Tibetan area, an in person interview with the PRC Embassy or Consulate officer in charge of Tibetan affairs, and submission of personal documents such as copies of naturalization certificates, birth certificates, school and work records, affidavits and other materials. Tibetan Americans reported more frequent harassment by security officials in Tibetan areas than in other parts of China, including requirements to report to the local UFWD office where some were reportedly interrogated, threatened, and forced to download tracking software on their phones. Some members of the Tibetan American community reported they self-censored their behavior in the United States out of fear of retribution against their family members in Tibet or fear of losing future access to Tibet and threats from PRC officials. Despite these barriers, Tibetans also reported increased access to the TAR compared to previous years, particularly for those who hold United States or European passports. This information is anecdotal, with no concrete data available on the number of visas issued to Tibetan Americans.

Journalists

PRC regulations did not regularly require international journalists to obtain prior permission to travel to any part of the country other than the TAR. The PRC government heavily restricted and controlled access for U.S. journalists to the TAR. The PRC government has rejected the vast majority of U.S. journalists’ requests to visit and report from the TAR, according to data compiled by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China (FCCC), the professional organization for the international press corps based in China. When access was granted, PRC security officials monitored and controlled these journalists’ movements at all times. The FCCC’s 2022 annual report stated that none of the three foreign journalists who applied to travel to TAR were approved. In lieu of individual permits, the government relied on organized group tours of the region for registered reporters selected by PRC authorities.

When U.S. journalists gained access to Tibetan areas, the PRC government further suppressed their ability to report about Tibet by intimidating and preventing PRC citizens from interacting with foreign press. By hosting group tours, the government has been able to cite increased numbers and greater access to the region while maintaining strict control over the information conveyed.

Comparison Between Levels of Access for Tibetan and Non-Tibetan Areas

Diplomats and other officials

U.S. diplomats and other officials did not have to apply to travel to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR, though sometimes access to specific areas would be blocked and official meetings with local government, religious, and community leaders required local Foreign Affairs Office (FAO) permission, as was common practice in many localities throughout China. PRC security personnel have used conspicuous monitoring to intimidate those traveling to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR. Government-designated minders have followed diplomats and officials, prevented them from meeting or speaking with local contacts, questioned them, and restricted their movement. Official access to monasteries in Tibetan areas of Kardze (Chinese: Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP) in Sichuan province and Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) TAP in Sichuan province remained limited. During visits in previous years to Tibetan areas in Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Yunnan provinces, local authorities have prohibited U.S. diplomats from entering certain monasteries, blocked off specific roads, prevented them from having meetings or conversations with local interlocutors, and monitored their conversations.

Tourists

International tourists sometimes faced restrictions traveling to Tibetan areas outside the TAR. Some particularly sensitive areas, including areas with prominent monasteries or those with histories of protest activities, such as Ngaba (which saw a number of self-immolations following the 2008 uprising), restrict international tourists’ access.

Journalists

Although journalists were permitted to travel to areas outside the TAR with significant Tibetan populations, they have been subjected to invasive surveillance, physically blocked from certain areas, and intimidated by the government. According to the FCCC’s annual report covering 2022, foreign journalists experienced harassment while reporting in Tibetan areas outside the TAR.

Comparison of the Level of Access Between 2023 and 2022

Diplomats and other officials

Access to the Tibetan population of the PRC did not improve in 2023 compared to 2022. While COVID-19 restrictions have been rescinded, requests by U.S. and other diplomats to travel to the TAR have not been approved. The PRC has arranged tours of foreign diplomats as well as diplomatic events in the TAR, although in all cases, these are strictly controlled by the PRC government and do not allow meaningful access to the population of the TAR.

Journalists

The FCCC’s 2022 annual report noted that access to the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) remains officially restricted for foreign journalists. Reporters must apply to the government for special permission or join a press tour organized by China’s State Council or Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). Three journalists applied for permission in 2022, but all were turned down. The report cites a journalist from a Western outlet who was stopped and detained by police and local officials in a Tibetan area of Sichuan, with officials claiming foreigners were not being allowed in because of COVID controls.

Required Permits and Other Measures Impeding Freedom to Travel in Tibetan areas

In addition to the permits and other restrictions described above, visitors whose requests for a Tibet travel permit the PRC government approved in previous years have faced additional access barriers once in the TAR. According to travel agents operating in the TAR, the Tibet travel permit did not allow visits to all areas. Some areas were generally closed to visitors and required an additional alien travel permit from the TAR Public Security Bureau. Tourists planning to visit certain border areas also required a military area entry permit from the Military Affairs Office and a foreign affairs permit from the TAR FAO.

The PRC government did not disclose its decision-making process for granting permission to travel to the TAR, nor did it share the names of officials involved in issuing travel permits to U.S. citizens to visit the TAR.

Historically, PRC authorities assessed each U.S. official request to visit the TAR on a case-by-case basis. The TAR FAO generally required a diplomatic note for any official visit, accompanied by a list of trip attendees. Once the TAR government received the request, it reportedly informed a foreign affairs leading committee, consisting of representatives at the prefectural, provincial, and central levels from the UFWD, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Public Security, People’s Liberation Army, and MFA. This committee reviewed the request, although frequently, no specific response was provided.",USA

Significant human rights issues included credible reports of: serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom including censorship; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association; inability of citizens to change their government peacefully through free and fair elections; serious and unreasonable restrictions on political participation; and trafficking in persons.

The government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who may have committed human rights abuses.

Section 1.
Respect for the Integrity of the Person

a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings

There were no reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings.

b. Disappearance

There were no reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities.

c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and Other Related Abuses

The law prohibited such practices, and there were no credible reports government officials employed them.

Prison and Detention Center Conditions

There were no significant reports regarding conditions that raised human rights concerns.

Administration: The law allowed prisoners and detainees to submit complaints to judicial authorities without censorship and to request investigation of alleged deficiencies. Judges and prosecutors in previous years visited prisons at least once a month to hear prisoner complaints.

Independent Monitoring: The government permitted monitoring by independent nongovernmental observers.

d. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention

The law prohibited arbitrary arrest and detention and provided for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of their arrest or detention in court, and the government generally observed these requirements.

Arrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees

Authorities detained persons with warrants issued by a duly authorized official based on evidence deemed sufficient by the authorities. Detainees had access to a lawyer of their choice or, if indigent, to one provided by the government. Police were required to present persons in custody to an examining judge within 48 hours of detention. Investigations by the prosecuting attorney were required to end with charges or dismissal within eight months, or six months when the defendant remained in detention. The pretrial inquiry stage was required to conclude within four months, or two months if the defendant was in detention. There was a functioning bail system.

e. Denial of Fair Public Trial

The law provided for an independent judiciary, and the government generally respected judicial independence and impartiality. Observers said that administrative actions by the court in some cases affected the fairness of the proceedings. For example, a March prosecution alleged two former directors of the public works bureau took bribes to facilitate local property development. The defense lawyers filed a complaint noting the judge rejected their request to rehear witnesses after the prosecution amended the charge sheet and limited the duration of closing statements for each defendant to 40 minutes. Observers argued such arrangements undermined the defendants’ right to a competent and effective defense.

Trial Procedures

The law provided for the right to a fair public trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right.  A case could be presided over by one judge or a group of judges, depending on the type of crime and the maximum penalty involved.

The Special Administrative Region’s (SAR) civil code judicial system derived from the Portuguese legal system.  The courts could rule on matters that were the responsibility of the government of the People’s Republic of China or concern the relationship between central authorities and the SAR.  Before making their final judgment, which was not subject to appeal, the courts had to seek an interpretation of the relevant provisions from the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.  The Basic Law required that courts follow the standing committee’s interpretations when cases intersect with central government jurisdiction, although judgments previously rendered were not affected.  As the final interpreter of the Basic Law, the standing committee also had the power to initiate interpretations of the Basic Law.

Political Prisoners and Detainees

There were no reports of political prisoners or detainees.

f. Transnational Repression

Not applicable.

g. Property Seizure and Restitution

Not applicable.

h. Arbitrary or Unlawful Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence

The law prohibited such actions, and there were no reports that the government failed to respect these prohibitions. The SAR’s public surveillance system included facial recognition capabilities; legal experts and opposition leaders feared the system could be used to target individuals and breach privacy laws.

The law regulating the interception and protection of communications (commonly known as “wiretapping law”) came into effect in August 2022. It allowed authorities, with prior authorization from a judge, to use “eavesdropping devices” to intercept or record telephone or other electronic communications without the consent of the parties involved. The law also allowed police to request communication records from social media operators, even if they were not located or headquartered in the SAR. Some activists expressed concerns that the provisions of the wiretapping bill were an overly broad expansion of surveillance authority.

The amended National Security Law (NSL), which came into effect in May, permitted the interception of communications with prior judicial consent when the content was deemed to present a risk to national security. Unlike the wiretapping law, any alleged national security information intercepted by authorities had to be approved by a designated judge before being admissible in court, otherwise it was classified as intelligence for law enforcement purposes only.

Section 2.
Respect for Civil Liberties

a. Freedom of Expression, Including for Members of the Press and Other Media

The law provided for freedom of expression, including for members of the press and other media, but the government encroached upon this right.

Freedom of Expression: The government significantly restricted public statements that it contended would undermine “social harmony” or that “endangered” national or public interest.

In January a Hong Kong resident who criticized the Hong Kong government online was denied entry into the SAR on the grounds that his public remarks contained seditious content. Border authorities also denied entry to a Hong Kong district councilor in March after deeming his remarks to be a risk to Macau’s public security. Some observers criticized broad provisions of the amended NSL, noting it could allow for arbitrary law enforcement and potentially result in a chilling effect on media and individual freedoms.

Censorship or Content Restrictions for Members of the Press and Other Media, Including Online Media: The SAR imposed restrictions on press freedom and urged media to align itself with government positions. The Reporters Without Borders East Bureau director criticized the revised NSL’s broad and extraterritorial remit as “increase[ing] the pressure on journalists and further threaten[ing] the residents’ right to information.” Reporters Without Borders also noted “the original regulation was already dangerously open to interpretation, and the expansion of its scope makes it the perfect tool for the government to intimidate, and possibly detain, the journalists they dislike.”

The Macau Journalists Association published several critiques in recent years on the seriousness of censorship of media, noting limits on coverage of prodemocracy activists and organizations, barring the use of names in certain reports, and the removal or alteration of reports that did not comply with government directives.

Libel/Slander Laws: The law criminalized libel, slander, and defamation. If such offenses were committed through media or online, conviction carried sentences of up to two years’ imprisonment. There were no reports the law was used.

Internet Freedom

There were no public reports that the government overtly restricted or disrupted access to the internet or censor online content.

b. Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association

The law provided for the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association, but the government restricted the freedom of peaceful assembly.

Freedom of Peaceful Assembly

The law required prior notification to, but did not require approval by, the Public Security Police for demonstrations involving public roads, public places, or places open to the public. Police could redirect demonstration marching routes, but organizers had the right to challenge such decisions in court. Civil rights advocates criticized the apparently arbitrary rules restricting peaceful assembly.

In June the Tiananmen Square massacre commemoration organizer in the SAR – the Union for Democratic Development – announced it had officially disbanded, citing fear of political prosecution under the NSL. It highlighted a 2022 court ruling that annual commemorations held for the past three decades were unlawful and subversive in nature.

c. Freedom of Religion

See the Department of State’s International Religious Freedom Report at https://www.state.gov/religiousfreedomreport/.

d. Freedom of Movement

The law provided for freedom of internal movement, foreign travel, emigration, and repatriation, and the government generally respected these rights.

The amended NSL enacted in May empowered authorities to restrict the departure of anyone in the SAR suspected of violating national security laws for up to five days, with prior approval from judicial authorities.

e. Protection of Refugees

The government communicated with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations regarding the few applicants for refugee or asylum status who arrived in the SAR.

Access to Asylum: The law provided for the granting of asylum or refugee status, and there was a system for providing protection to refugees. Persons granted refugee status ultimately enjoyed the same rights as other SAR residents.

Pending final decisions on their asylum claims, the government registered asylum seekers and provided protection against their expulsion or return to their countries of origin. There were few applicants for refugee or asylum status and no successful applicants.

Persons with pending applications were eligible to receive government support, including for basic needs such as housing, medical care, and education for children, but were not allowed to work until their refugee status was granted.

Section 3.
Freedom to Participate in the Political Process

The law limited voters’ ability to change their government through free and fair periodic elections because there was no universal suffrage in elections for most elected positions. Only a small fraction of citizens played a role in the selection of the chief executive, who was chosen in 2019 by a 400-member election committee, 344 of whom were elected from four broad societal sectors: the industrial, commercial, and financial sector; the cultural, educational, and professional sector; the sports sector; and the labor, social services, religious, and others sector. The remaining 56 members were chosen from and by the SAR’s legislators and representatives to the National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.

Elections and Political Participation

Abuses or Irregularities in Recent Elections: The elections in 2021 for 14 directly elected seats in the 33-member Legislative Assembly were not generally free and fair, as the government disqualified all prodemocracy politicians from running.

Political Parties and Political Participation: The SAR had no laws on political parties. Politically active groups registered as societies or limited liability companies were active in promoting their political agendas. Those seeking elected office had to swear their allegiance to Macau and to upholding the Basic Law. Those critical of the government faced restrictions and were disqualified from running in the most recent election.

Section 4.
Corruption in Government

The law provided criminal penalties for official corruption, and the government generally implemented the law effectively. The SAR’s Commission Against Corruption was a statutory independent body whose main duty was to combat corruption, bribery, and other illegal activities in both public and private sectors. SAR residents could report corruption or administrative misconduct by name or anonymously.

Corruption: The Commission Against Corruption investigated the public and private sectors and had the power to arrest and detain suspects. The Ombudsman Bureau within the commission reviewed complaints of mismanagement or abuse by the commission. An independent monitoring committee outside the commission accepted and reviewed complaints concerning commission personnel.

For additional information about corruption in the SAR, see the Department of State’s Investment Climate Statement, and the Department of State’s International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which includes information on financial crimes.

Section 5.
Governmental Posture Towards International and Nongovernmental Monitoring and Investigation of Alleged Abuses of Human Rights

Domestic and international groups monitoring human rights generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials were somewhat cooperative and responsive to their views.

Section 6.
Discrimination and Societal Abuses

Women

Rape and Domestic Violence: The law criminalized rape of women and men, including spousal rape, and domestic violence, although the domestic violence law did not cover same-sex couples. Rape was punishable by three to 12 years’ imprisonment; the law on rape was effectively enforced.

The domestic violence law allowed a judge to order urgent coercive measures against alleged abusers for up to five years, and the application of these measures did not preclude the possibility of criminal prosecution of the suspects. Domestic violence was punishable by one to five years imprisonment; sentences could be increased if a victim was younger than age 14. The government did not effectively enforce the domestic violence law. Lawmakers and social welfare nongovernmental organizations stated the enforcement of the domestic violence law was insufficient, as there was a high number of reports but insufficient investigation and prosecution of reported cases.

Other Forms of Gender-based Violence or Harassment: The law criminalized physical sexual harassment, but verbal and noncontact forms of harassment were not covered by the law. There were no public reports that the government did not effectively enforce the law. Persons convicted of sexual harassment could be imprisoned for up to one year.

Discrimination: Women enjoyed the same legal rights as men, including civil liberties, employment, commercial activity, and education. Equal opportunity legislation mandated women receive equal pay for equal work. The law prohibited discrimination in hiring practices based on gender or physical ability and allowed for civil suits. Penalties existed for employers who violated these guidelines, and the government generally enforced the law effectively. Media reports, however, indicated discrimination persisted and gender differences in occupation existed, with women concentrated in lower-paid sectors and lower-level jobs.

In March, a United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ report noted gender stereotypes still had a significant impact on women’s participation in the labor market, leading most women to enter traditionally women-dominated sectors such as catering, while the number of women in senior positions in government and private companies remained low.

Reproductive Rights: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government authorities.

The government provided access to sexual and reproductive health services for sexual violence survivors, including emergency contraception and postexposure prophylaxis.

Systemic Racial or Ethnic Violence and Discrimination

The law did not fully protect members of racial or ethnic minority groups against violence and discrimination.

Children

Child Abuse: The law prohibited any form of mistreatment or cruel treatment of children. The law included corporal punishment of children among criminal forms of violence if committed with the intention of harming a child.

Child, Early, and Forced Marriage: The minimum legal age of marriage was 16; however, children ages 16 to 18 who wished to marry had to obtain approval from their parents or guardians. There were no public reports that the government did not enforce the law effectively.

Sexual Exploitation of Children: The law specifically provided for criminal punishment for sexual abuse of children and students, statutory rape, and procurement of children for sexual exploitation. The criminal code set 14 years as the age of sexual consent.

The law forbade using a person younger than age 18 for commercial sexual exploitation, including child sex trafficking. The law also prohibited child pornography. The government generally enforced these laws effectively, but there were concerns regarding the exploitation of children in commercial sex.

Sexual harassment of children was also a crime; if the victim was younger than age 14, the perpetrator could be punished with up to three years in prison.

Antisemitism

The Jewish population was extremely small. There were no reports of antisemitic incidents.

Trafficking in Persons

See the Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/.

Acts of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity or Expression, or Sex Characteristics

Criminalization: The law did not criminalize consensual same-sex sexual conduct between individuals.

Violence and Harassment: Reports of violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex (LGBTQI+) individuals were rare, and civil society organizations generally assessed police response as adequate.

Discrimination: The law prohibited discrimination in employment on the grounds of sexual orientation and was enforced; however, the law did not prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in other areas, such as housing. The SAR did not recognize same-sex marriage.

Availability of Legal Gender Recognition: Legal gender recognition was not available, even for those who had undergone gender-affirming surgery outside of the SAR.

Involuntary or Coercive Medical or Psychological Practices: Rainbow of Macau, an LGBTQI+ organization, did not report any cases of so-called conversion therapy, nor did the SAR government or medical associations condemn so-called conversion therapy practices.

Restrictions of Freedom of Expression, Association, or Peaceful Assembly: There were no reports of such restrictions specifically for LGBTQI+ individuals or groups. In February a group of LGBTQI+ advocates successfully organized the first-ever Macau International Queer Film Festival, showcasing 17 films.

Persons with Disabilities

Persons with disabilities could access education, health services, public buildings, and transportation on an equal basis with others. The law mandated access to buildings, public facilities, information, and communications for persons with disabilities. The government enforced the law effectively. The SAR operated an education system for students with special educational needs or disabilities. The government excluded persons with disabilities and domestic workers from the minimum wage law. The law prohibited discrimination in hiring practices based on gender or physical ability and allowed for civil suits.

Section 7.
Worker Rights

a. Freedom of Association and the Right to Collective Bargaining

Although the Basic Law provided for the right of workers to form and join unions, the Legislative Assembly had not passed legislation to regulate this right. Because workers had the right to join labor associations, unions existed in the form of ordinary associations and could therefore only express nonbinding opinions to management. Moreover, the government wielded considerable influence over some of these labor associations.

The law did not provide the right for workers to bargain collectively, and while workers had a legal right to conduct strikes, there was no specific protection in the law from retribution if workers exercised that right, and no strikes occurred. The law prohibited some “antiunion” discrimination, stated employees or job seekers should not be prejudiced, deprived of any rights, or exempted from any duties based on their membership in a labor association. There were no reports the government threatened or was violent towards labor leaders. The law stipulated the financial penalties for antiunion discrimination; an employer could be fined for every worker discriminated against. The law did not require reinstatement of workers dismissed for union activity.

The law forbade workers in certain professions, such as the security forces, to form unions, to take part in protests, or to strike. Such groups had organizations that provided welfare and other services to members and could speak to the government on behalf of members. Most other public employees, and vulnerable groups of workers, including domestic workers and migrant workers, could freely associate and form associations.

Workers who believed they were dismissed unlawfully could bring a case to court or lodge a complaint with the Labor Affairs Bureau (LAB) or the Commission against Corruption.

Government and employers did not respect collective bargaining and freedom of association. Government influenced the selection of association officials and interfered in the functioning of workers’ organizations. Penalties for violations of the law were not commensurate with those for other similar violations and were rarely applied.

In May President Wong Wai-man of the Bar Bending Industry Workers’ Union called off a small-scale May 1 Labor Day march due to soft and hard lobbying by police. Wong said he was accosted by plainclothes policemen for days after he notified police about the march, and some uniformed officers subsequently advised him to cancel the march to avoid it being “hijacked and politicized.” Within two days of Wong’s allegations, the secretary for security ordered the Judiciary Police to conduct a thorough investigation. On May 10, the Judiciary Police found that Wong’s allegation was unsubstantiated.

b. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor

See the Department of State’s Trafficking in Persons Report at https://www.state.gov/trafficking-in-persons-report/.

c. Prohibition of Child Labor and Minimum Age for Employment

The law prohibited all the worst forms of child labor. A law prohibited children younger than age 16 from working, although children ages 14 and 15 could work in “exceptional circumstances” if they obtained a health certificate to prove they had the “necessary robust physique to engage in a professional activity.” The law governing the number of working hours was equally applicable to adults and legally working children, but the law prohibited children from working overtime hours.

The law prohibited children younger than age 16 from certain types of work, including but not limited to domestic work, employment between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., and employment at places where admission of children was forbidden, such as casinos. The government required employers to assess the nature, extent, and duration of risk exposure at work before recruiting or employing a child. These regulations protected children from physically hazardous work, including exposure to dangerous chemicals, and jobs deemed inappropriate due to the child’s age.

The LAB was responsible for enforcing the law through periodic and targeted inspections and prosecutions but did so inconsistently. LAB operations were adequately resourced, but there were no prosecutions for labor trafficking and the Public Prosecutions Office did not convict any traffickers during the year.

Penalties for noncompliance with minimum wage law and child labor provisions fell under the labor ordinance and were financial; they were not comparable to those for other analogous serious crimes, such as kidnapping. If a child was a victim of forced labor, however, the penalties were commensurate with those for kidnapping. Penalties were regularly applied against violators.

There were no confirmed reports during the year of the worst forms of child labor.

d. Discrimination (see section 6)

e. Acceptable Conditions of Work

Wage and Hour Laws: Labor laws established the general principle of fair wages and mandated compliance with wage agreements. The SAR did not calculate an official poverty line, but the minimum wage was well above the World Bank’s poverty line. The law provided for a 48-hour workweek, an eight-hour workday, paid overtime, annual leave, health care, and maternity care. The law provided for a 24-hour rest period each week. All workers, whether under a term contract or an indefinite contract, were entitled to benefits including specified working hours, weekly time off, statutory holidays, annual leave, and sick leave. The law prohibited excessive overtime but permitted legal overtime (a maximum of eight hours per day and irrespective of workers’ consent) in force majeure situations or in response to external shocks, at the discretion of the employer. Overtime and wage laws were part of the labor ordinance, which was part of the civil code; penalties for their violation were exclusively financial penalty and were not commensurate with penalties for similar crimes, such as fraud, which was a criminal violation for which imprisonment could be ordered. The construction sector had the highest rate of overtime payment arrears or wage garnishments.

All workers, including migrants, had access to the courts in cases in which an employee was unlawfully dismissed, an employer failed to pay compensation, or a worker believed their legitimate interests were violated. If an employer dismissed staff “without just cause,” the employer had to provide economic compensation indexed to an employee’s length of service. In June a group of Filipino migrant workers won a civil case against their former employer, who was found guilty of nonpayment of wages and other offenses. The court awarded the workers almost 240,000 patacas ($30,000) in back pay.

The LAB provided assistance and legal advice to workers upon request, and cases of labor-related malpractice were referred to the LAB.

Occupational Safety and Health: The law required that employers provide a safe working environment. The LAB set industry-appropriate occupational safety and health (OSH) standards and enforced occupational safety and health regulations. Failure to correct infractions could lead to prosecution. Inspectors, and not the worker, were responsible for identifying dangerous working conditions.

The law allowed workers to remove themselves from hazardous conditions without jeopardy to their employment. The most hazardous sector of the SAR’s economy was the construction industry. In 2022 the LAB imposed fines of 6,500 patacas ($810) on two employers judged responsible for accidents that occurred due to discrepancies and irregularities in the work environment. The LAB also fined 29 employers a total of 195,500 patacas ($24,400) for failing to comply with workers’ compensation requirements. The LAB enforced OSH laws to ensure safe workplace conditions and standards at construction, commercial, and industrial sites. LAB enforcement officers conducted OSH compliance inspections on a regular basis, as well as unannounced visits to hazardous sites such as docks. Workers could make OSH complaints in person at six different service locations or anonymously by email, telephone, fax, or mail. LAB actively investigated OSH complaints.

Wage, Hour, and OSH Enforcement: The government effectively enforced minimum wage, overtime, and OSH laws. Penalties for violations were not specified in the labor ordinance, other than holding the employer liable and were, therefore, not commensurate with those for similar crimes, such as fraud and negligence. Penalties were regularly applied against violators. The number of labor inspectors was adequate to enforce compliance. Inspectors were authorized to conduct unannounced visits and levy sanctions, especially targeting construction sites where industrial accidents often occurred. Civil rights advocates criticized the minimum wage regime because it did not apply to nonresident domestic workers or persons with disabilities.

LAB encouraged employers to adhere to wage, hour, and OSH regulations through a variety of methods, particularly through close collaboration with casinos, the primary employers in the SAR.

Wage and hour regulations did not cover some vulnerable populations. For example, the minimum wage system did not apply to more than 100,000 migrant workers working in the SAR. Many OSH materials were only accessible in Chinese, which many migrant workers could not comprehend.",USA

The two sides exchanged views on China-U.S. relations and issues of mutual interest.

Wang Yi elaborated on China’s principled position on developing China-U.S. relations, emphasizing that both sides should translate the important common understandings of the two presidents into concrete policies and actions. China hopes that the U.S. can view China with an objective, rational, and pragmatic attitude, formulate its policies toward China with the goal of peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation, engage with China in an equal, respectful, and mutually beneficial manner, and work with China to explore the right way for the two countries to get along well with each other in the new era.

Paulson in Beijing.

Ding Xuexiang noted that not long ago, President Xi Jinping had a phone call with President Donald J. Trump at the latter's request, and the two heads of state reached important common understandings. Strengthening cooperation between China and the United States based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation is conducive to the sustained and sound development of China-U.S. relations, which can benefit both countries and the world. Stressing that China represents the greatest factor of certainty in today's turbulent world, Ding Xuexiang expressed the hope that the United States will correctly view China's development, respect China's core interests and major concerns, develop mutually beneficial and stable economic and trade relations, and jointly fulfill the responsibilities of major countries. He welcomes the Paulson Institute and U.S. enterprises to come to China for cooperation, and to play a positive role in promoting mutual trust and cooperation between China and the United States.

260625,Wang Yi Meets with Professor from Harvard University of the United States Graham Allison,"On June 25, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with Professor from Harvard University of the United States Graham Allison in Beijing.

Wang Yi commended Graham Allison for his efforts to enhance mutual understanding between China and the United States and explore ways for the two countries to get along with each other. He said that Chinese people value the concept of ""seeking harmony without uniformity"", a traditional Eastern philosophy fundamentally different from the Western zero-sum mindset, which is characterized by a black-and-white and I-win-you-lose approach. It emphasizes achieving harmonious coexistence based on acknowledging and respecting differences, with the goal of fostering and expanding common interests among nations. China and the United States now need to develop a new narrative that can regulate future interactions between the two major countries.

Wang Yi said that the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forth by President Xi Jinping are the fundamental guidelines that China follows in handling affairs related to the United States. He expressed hope that the U.S. side will work with China to address the issue of mutual perception, which is fundamental to the China-U.S. relationship, just like the first button of a shirt that must be put right, and to find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other under the guidance of the three principles. He also expressed the hope that insightful people from all walks of life in the United States will play an active role in forming an objective and positive perception of China and promoting proper exchanges and interactions between China and the United States.

Graham Allison said that the concept of ""seeking harmony without uniformity"" shares common ground with the U.S. value of respecting diversity. The United States and China live on the same planet, with interests closely interlinked and futures deeply interlocked. Both sides should find a strategic positioning for coexistence to avoid falling into the ""Thucydides Trap"". This is crucial for both countries and the world. The United States and China should establish a new principled framework for the future development of bilateral relations, with mutual respect as the first principle. Graham Allison expressed his willingness to continue contributing to communication and exchanges between the two sides and the stable development of bilateral relations.",China
050625,President Xi Jinping Speaks with U.S. President Donald J. Trump on the Phone,"On the evening of June 5, President Xi Jinping took a phone call from U.S. President Donald J. Trump.

President Xi pointed out that recalibrating the direction of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations requires us to take the helm and set the right course. It is particularly important to steer clear of the various disturbances and disruptions. At the suggestion of the U.S. side, the two countries’ lead officials recently held an economic and trade meeting in Geneva. It marked an important step forward in resolving the relevant issues through dialogue and consultation, and was welcomed by both societies and the international community. It proved that dialogue and cooperation is the only right choice. The two sides need to make good use of the economic and trade consultation mechanism already in place, and seek win-win results in the spirit of equality and respect for each other’s concerns. The Chinese side is sincere about this, and at the same time has its principles. The Chinese always honor and deliver what has been promised. Both sides should make good on the agreement reached in Geneva. In fact, China has been seriously and earnestly executing the agreement. The U.S. side should acknowledge the progress already made, and remove the negative measures taken against China. The two sides should enhance communication in such fields as foreign affairs, economy and trade, military, and law enforcement to build consensus, clear up misunderstandings, and strengthen cooperation.

President Xi emphasized that the United States must handle the Taiwan question with prudence, so that the fringe separatists bent on “Taiwan independence” will not be able to drag China and America into the dangerous terrain of confrontation and even conflict. 

President Trump said that he has great respect for President Xi, and the U.S.-China relationship is very important. The U.S. wants the Chinese economy to do very well. The U.S. and China working together can get a lot of great things done. The U.S. will honor the one-China policy. The meeting in Geneva was very successful, and produced a good deal. The U.S. will work with China to execute the deal. The U.S. loves to have Chinese students coming to study in America.

Wang Yi welcomed David Perdue to his new post and expressed hope that he will act as a reliable communicator, a mediator of differences, and a promoter of cooperation between China and the United States, and play a positive role in advancing the sound, steady and sustainable development of bilateral relations. Wang Yi stated that China-U.S. relations are now at an important and critical juncture. Looking back on the journey of nearly half a century, with all its ups and downs, since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the most important lesson is that equality and mutual respect are the prerequisites for exchanges between the two sides, and dialogue and cooperation remain the only correct choice.

Wang Yi emphasized that following the economic and trade meeting in Geneva, China has earnestly and strictly implemented the consensus reached by both sides. However, he expressed regret that the United States has recently introduced a series of negative measures based on groundless reasons, infringing upon China's legitimate rights and interests. China firmly opposes such actions. Wang Yi called on the United States to work with China in the same direction and earnestly implement the important common understandings reached during the phone call between the two heads of state in January this year, so as to create the necessary conditions for the return of China-U.S. relations to the right track.

David Perdue said that President Donald Trump holds great respect for President Xi Jinping, and that positive and constructive engagement between the two heads of state is very important.

210525,Wang Yi Meets with President of the U.S. Asia Society Kyung-wha Kang,"On May 20, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with President of the U.S. Asia Society Kyung-wha Kang in Beijing.

Wang Yi said, China's policy toward the United States remains consistent and stable, and is always guided by the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping. Recently, progress has been made in the China-U.S. high-level meeting on economic and trade affairs, which once again proves that equal dialogue, mutual respect and proper handling of each other's legitimate concerns serve the common interests of both China and the United States. At the same time, however, the United States continues to suppress and contain China's legitimate right to development. Its recent move to seek a complete blockade on China's chips is a blatant act of unilateralism and bullying. China firmly opposes this.

Wang Yi said, major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics is rooted in China's 5,000-year-old civilization. It advocates for the practice of true multilateralism and open regionalism, aims to gather the greatest consensus for solidarity and cooperation, and works to address global challenges together. The Asia-Pacific region is where the common interests of China and the United States converge, and at the meantime, a focal area for their contradictions and differences. China and the United States should achieve positive interactions in the Asia-Pacific region first, thereby establishing a correct way for the two countries to get along with each other and finding effective channels for win-win cooperation. China appreciates the commitment of the Asia Society to enhancing dialogue, exchange and mutual understanding between China and the United States, and hopes that the Asia Society will continue to serve as a bridge to enhance the correct understanding of China among the American public.

Kyung-wha Kang said that the Asia Society has a deep understanding of China's millennia-old cultural heritage and is willing to continue sharing fact-based and objective views on China, and work with more insightful people in the United States to build platforms for dialogue to dispel misunderstandings and promote mutual understanding.",China

Lin Jian: We noted relevant reports. China all along believes that the only right choice for settling the issue is through political and diplomatic means.

Against the current backdrop, it’s all the more important for parties to the Iranian nuclear issue to work in the same direction, strengthen dialogue and engagement, and avoid any escalation. As the country which unilaterally withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and caused the current situation, the U.S. needs to show political sincerity, act in the spirit of mutual respect, engage in dialogue and consultation, and stop the threat of force and maximum pressure.

China will continue to maintain communication with relevant parties, actively promote talks for peace, and help relevant parties reach as early as possible a diplomatic settlement to the Iranian nuclear issue that accommodates all parties’ legitimate concerns so as to uphold the international non-proliferation regime and keep the Middle East peaceful and stable.",China
160425,Foreign Ministry Spokesperson’s Remarks on China Issuing Warrants for U.S. Agents in Cyber Attacks,"AFP: The Harbin Public Security Bureau said today they implicated 3 U.S. agents in cyber attacks during the Asian Winter Games earlier this year. I just wonder if the Ministry would like to comment on this case.

Lin Jian: We have noted the report, and have repeatedly made clear China’s position. During the 9th Asian Winter Games, the U.S. government launched cyber attacks on the information system of the Games and critical information infrastructure in Heilongjiang Province, causing grave harm to the security of China’s critical information infrastructure, national defense, finance, society, production and citizen’s personal information. China condemns the malicious cyber operations conducted by the U.S. government, which is truly egregious.

China has raised clear concerns to the U.S. through various means on its cyber attacks against China’s critical infrastructure.

China will continue to take what is necessary to safeguard its own cybersecurity.",China

Trump administration officials said that the U.S. will pursue more aggressive cyber strikes against China. What is China’s comment on this?

Lin Jian: This news report is complete disinformation that distorts reality and seriously contradicts the facts.

On “Volt Typhoon”, China, on various occasions, has explicitly  rejected the groundless and unreasonable accusations from the U.S. and briefed the U.S. on relevant investigation reports by China’s cybersecurity agencies, uncovering the truth of the U.S. intelligence agency’s framing and smearing of China. China has made it clear to the U.S. on various occasions that China opposes U.S. abusing cyber issues to interfere in China’s internal affairs, and any U.S. attempt to use Taiwan to contain China is doomed to fail.

What needs to be stressed is that China has expressed clear concerns to the U.S. through various means regarding the U.S. administration authorizing the Department of Defense to conduct offensive cyber operations against other countries, U.S. cyberattacks against China’s critical infrastructure, and cyber military cooperation between the U.S. and Taiwan. China urges the U.S. to adopt a responsible attitude, so as to avoid miscalculation. China will take all necessary measures to safeguard its cybersecurity.",China

Wang Yi said that China and the United States share extensive interests and broad prospects for cooperation, and can achieve mutual success to benefit the world. At present, China-U.S. relationship is at a critical juncture of where it is heading. Both sides should take the important common understandings and vision of the two heads of state as a guide, enhance communication, deepen mutual understanding, avoid misjudgments and manage differences.

Evan G. Greenberg said that the U.S.-China relationship is the most significant bilateral relationship in the world.

Li Qiang said that currently, the development of China-U.S. relations has reached a new critical juncture. In January this year, President Xi Jinping emphasized in a phone call with President Donald Trump that China and the United States have extensive common interests and broad space of cooperation, and can become partners and friends, contribute to each other's success, and advance shared prosperity for the good of the two countries and the whole world. History has proven that both China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Both sides should choose dialogue rather than confrontation, and choose win-win cooperation instead of a zero-sum game. Li Qiang expressed the hope that the United States will move further with China in the same direction, engage in candid communication and build trust and dispel misgivings in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, deepen practical cooperation, and make joint efforts to promote the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations.

Li Qiang pointed out that economic and trade cooperation is an important foundation of China-U.S. relations. Over the past few decades, the fruitful economic and trade cooperation achieved between China and the United States is the result of joint efforts of both sides and should be cherished. The more difficulties China-U.S. relations face, the more important it is to safeguard and develop China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, in a bid to continue injecting stability into bilateral relations. Trade wars produce no winners. No country can achieve development and prosperity through imposing tariffs, but only through openness and cooperation. Li Qiang called on the two sides to solve problems such as trade imbalance by making the pie of cooperation bigger and creating more incremental benefits. China always welcomes companies from all over the world, including the United States, to share development opportunities in China, and will actively address their legitimate demands, treat domestic and foreign-funded companies as equals, and continue to foster a sound business environment.

People from the U.S. side said that great changes have taken place in China in recent decades.

190225,"Remarks by H.E. Wang Yi at the United Nations Security Council High-Level Meeting “Practicing Multilateralism, Reforming and Improving Global Governance”","Your Excellency Secretary General António Guterres,
Colleagues,

I would like to thank Secretary General Guterres for attending this meeting and for his briefing.

The year 2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. Eighty years ago, our forefathers, with strenuous struggle and tremendous sacrifice, won the great victory of the Anti-Fascist war; the international community drew painful lessons from the scourge of two world wars; and the United Nations was founded. Multilateralism gradually became the main trend of the times. New historical chapters were opened in global governance.

The past 80 years is a period of accelerated advancement in world multipolarity and economic globalization, a period that has witnessed people across the world forging ahead and meeting challenges together, and also a period during which the Global South has been rising and growing in strength. Meanwhile, although human society has emerged from the shadows of the Cold War and moved beyond the bipolar standoff, comprehensive peace and shared prosperity remain elusive. In the third decade of the 21st century, peace and development remains a long-term, arduous task.

The 80 years of history is enlightenment enough: In the face of the turbulent and changing international landscape, the U.N.-centered international system provides important safeguards for the cause of human progress, and the vision of multilateralism with coordination and cooperation as its cornerstone is the best solution to global issues. In the face of the historical trend of shared future, no country can prosper alone; mutually beneficial cooperation is the right choice. In the face of the profoundly changing international landscape, the Global South should not only achieve the historic feat of moving toward modernization together, but also remain at the forefront of improving the global governance system.

Mr. Secretary General,
Colleagues,

To chart our course for the future, we should not forget why we started out in the beginning. Today, transformation not seen in a century is accelerating across the world, geopolitical conflicts keep escalating, multiple crises are emerging, and instability and uncertainty are increasingly prominent. In a time of intensifying turbulence and transformation, we need, more than ever, to remind ourselves of the founding mission of the U.N., reinvigorate true multilateralism, and speed up the efforts to build a more just and equitable global governance system. In this connection, China proposes the following:

First, upholding sovereign equality. All countries are equal, regardless of size or strength. This is the foremost principle in the U.N. Charter. In advancing global governance, all countries have the right to participate as equals, make decisions as equals, and benefit as equals. We must respect the development paths chosen independently by people of all countries, uphold the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, and not impose one’s will upon others. We must practice international rule of law, ensure the effective implementation of international law, and reject double standards and selective application. Resolutions of the Security Council are binding, and should be observed by all countries. The Security Council is entrusted with authority, and such authority should be upheld by all countries. Any act of bullying, trickery or extortion is a flagrant violation of the basic norms of international relations. Any unilateral sanction that circumvents Security Council authorization lacks legal basis, defies justification and contradicts common sense.

Second, upholding fairness and justice. A critical part of global governance is to ensure that justice prevails. Since the end of World War II, a large number of countries in the Global South have emerged on the world stage, which has revealed growing incompatibility and irrationality in the global governance structure. Under the new circumstances, international affairs should no longer be monopolized by a small number of countries. Countries in the Global South have the right to speak up for and defend their legitimate rights and interests. The fruits of development should no longer be taken by just a few countries. People of all countries have the right to a happy life. The reform of the Security Council should continue to emphasize democratic consultation, increase the representation and say of developing countries, especially African countries, and effectively redress historical injustice.

Third, upholding solidarity and coordination. Promoting international cooperation is an important purpose of the U.N. Charter, and a sure path toward improving global governance. Countries should commit to the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, replace confrontation with coordination, prevent lose-lose through win-win cooperation, and break down small circles with greater solidarity. Members cannot just sit by and watch multilateral institutions become dysfunctional and ineffective due to their own failure to cooperate. The Security Council must rise above narrow-minded geopolitical considerations, champion the spirit of solidarity and cooperation, fulfill its duties conferred by the U.N. Charter, and effectually play its role for the maintenance of international peace and security.

Fourth, upholding an action-oriented approach. Global governance has to be improved, not through words but through actions. In the face of protracted wars, loss of innocent lives, and challenges brought by new technologies, U.N. agencies should seek solutions rather than chant slogans. The Pact for the Future was adopted at the Summit of the Future last September. It is important to follow that up with coordinated efforts of implementation, i.e. to turn the road map into a construction plan and a wonderful vision into substantive actions.

The situation in the Middle East remains fragile and tense. Gaza and the West Bank are the homeland of the Palestinian people, not a bargaining chip in political trade-offs. “The Palestinians governing Palestine” is an important principle that must be followed in the post-conflict governance of Gaza. It is vital to uphold the two-State solution, press for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question, and bring lasting peace and security to the Middle East.

The Ukraine crisis has dragged on and kept escalating for nearly three years. Recently, the pursuit of dialogue and negotiation has gained momentum. Since the start of the crisis, China has been calling for a political settlement and pushing for peace talks. China supports all efforts conducive to peace. In line with the four points about what must be done proposed by President Xi Jinping, we will continue to work with other countries, especially the Global South countries, to make more objective, balanced and rational voices heard, to build consensus for ending the conflict, and to pave the way for peace.

Mr. Secretary General,
Colleagues, 

Eighty years ago, Chinese representatives were the first to solemnly sign the U.N. Charter, writing with a Chinese calligraphy brush an important chapter in world history. Since the restoration of the lawful seat of the People’s Republic of China in the U.N., we have remained steadfast in making China’s contribution to global governance. A community with a shared future for mankind, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative—the vision and initiatives put forth by President Xi Jinping represent China’s proposal for the reform and improvement of global governance. 

We pursue peace and security in global governance. As a major country with the best track record on peace and security, China is committed to following a path of peaceful development, to resolving disputes and differences by peaceful means, and to constructively promoting the settlement of hotspot issues. Chinese Blue Helmets have become a crucial force in U.N. peacekeeping operations, keeping the hope of world peace alive.

We advance common development in global governance. As the largest developing country in the world, China pursues high-quality development as a top priority and promotes high-standard opening up with firm resolve. It has become the major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions. China advocates a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization and promotes high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, as part of its contribution to the prosperity and development of countries around the world.

We champion openness and inclusiveness in global governance. As a time-honored civilization, China believes in harmony without uniformity, embraces inclusiveness, respects cultural diversity, and advocates humanity’s common values. China promotes exchanges, dialogue, and peaceful and harmonious coexistence among civilizations with a broad mind, in a bid to provide fresh impetus to the progress of human civilization.

We uphold multilateral cooperation in global governance. As a founding member of the United Nations, China takes the lead in following true multilateralism. China is a member of almost all universal intergovernmental organizations and a party to over 600 international conventions and their amendments. China supports the U.N. in playing a central role in international affairs and makes continuous contribution to the U.N. cause.

Mr. Secretary General,
Colleagues,

China in the new era is walking with big strides and confidence along the bright path of Chinese modernization. As it continues to make new progress, China will provide more opportunities for the modernization of the world. With the U.N. about to enter its next 80 years, China stands ready to work with all parties to draw wisdom from history, open a new era for multilateralism, and make global governance more fair and equitable.

Thank you.",China
270125,Xi Jinping Sends Chinese New Year Card in Return to Friends in U.S. State of Iowa,"On January 27, 2025, President Xi Jinping sent a Chinese New Year card in return to friends in U.S. State of Iowa. Xi Jinping said that 40 years ago when he visited the beautiful State of Iowa, he was warmly received by the people there, which is still fresh in his memory. China and the United States share extensive common interests and broad space for cooperation and can become partners and friends. China and the United States can help each other succeed and achieve common prosperity for the benefit of both countries and the world at large.

Wang Yi pointed out that President Xi Jinping had an important phone call with President Trump last Friday, during which they reached a series of common understandings. The development of China-U.S. relations has come to a new important juncture. President Xi comprehensively elaborated on China's policy toward the United States. President Trump made positive response, saying that he looks forward to maintaining good relations with President Xi and emphasizing that United States and China working together can solve many problems in the world.

Wang Yi said that the two heads of state have pointed out the direction and set the tone for China-US relations. Two teams need to implement their important common understandings and maintain communication, manage differences and expand cooperation in line with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, with a view to promoting the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations, and finding the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other in the new era.

Wang Yi said that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is the choice of the Chinese people. China's development has a clear historical logic and is driven by strong internal dynamism. Our goal is to deliver a better life for the people and make more contributions to the world. We have no intention of surpassing or replacing anyone, but we must defend our legitimate right to development.

Wang Yi elaborated on China's principled position on the Taiwan question and urged the U.S. side to handle it prudently. Wang emphasized that Taiwan has been part of China's territory since ancient times, and we will never allow Taiwan to be split from China. The United States has made solemn commitments on abiding by the one-China policy in the three joint communiques, and it should not renege on them.

Rubio said the United States and China are two great countries. The U.S.-China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the 21st century and will determine the future of the world. The United States hopes to have candid communication with China, resolve differences, manage the bilateral relationship in a mature and prudent manner, and work together to address global challenges and maintain peace and stability in the world. The United States does not support “Taiwan independence” and hopes that the Taiwan question can be resolved peacefully in a manner acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

Wang Yi said that big countries should act in a manner befitting their status, shoulder their due international responsibilities, maintain world peace and help countries realize common development. I hope you will act accordingly and play a constructive role for the future of the people of China and the United States, as well as for the peace and stability of the world.",China
190125,MFA Coordinator for Cyber and Digital Affairs Wang Lei Takes an Interview with CCTV,"Question 1: US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said recently that the US had “sent clear messages to the PRC about what it would actually mean if they acted to disrupt American critical infrastructure and how we would respond”. What is China’s response?

A: We have told the Biden administration explicitly that China rejects US blame on China concerning specific cases without providing any evidence. We’ve also raised concerns to the US side that China has detected long-lasting, systemic and massive US cyber attacks against China, including cyber espionage, as well as cyber attacks that compromise the security of critical infrastructure in areas such as telecommunication, finance and transportation. We also briefed to the US side of the scope and basis of classification of critical information infrastructure according to China’s legislation, and highlighted our seriousness on protecting security of China’s critical infrastructure. We specifically underscored that the US should first set a good example before asking others to do things.

The key to address relevant issue is that the US should take China’s concerns seriously, and discard the wrong mindset that the loudest voices are the wisest. It will not work for other countries if the US tries to set rules unilaterally from “a position of strength”.

Question 2: Cybersecurity has become a hot-spot issue of China-US relations. How does China think China and the US should handle their existing disagreement? How will China-US cyber relationship evolve in the long run?

A: President Xi Jinping has repeatedly and profoundly pointed out that two big countries like China and the US should not cut off their ties or turn their back on each other, still less slide into conflict or confrontation, that the two countries should respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation, and China-US relationship should continue moving forward in a stable, sound and sustainable way. China is willing to build a future-oriented China-US cyber relationship in adherence with this spirit.

China and the US do have our differences in cyber arena. However, it is entirely possible for the two sides to discuss any matters of concern in an open and candid manner on the premise of equality and mutual respect while taking facts as basis and common rules as criterion. More importantly, we should think through the following questions from a broader and longer term of view: what kind of China-US cyber relationship we need to establish, what kind of rules we need to apply with when interacting with each other, and how we can work together to find the right way to get along well with each other in cyberspace?

China and the US are the two most influential countries in global cyber arena, and also the two countries that are most dependent on cyberspace. The two sides share similar concerns regarding ensuring cybersecurity, in particular the security of critical infrastructure. Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is not only in the common interests of both sides, but also should be our shared goal. China is willing to engage in dialogues with the US to build peaceful, stable and mutually respectful cyber relations, which we firmly believe is the best way to address common concerns of both sides in the long run, in spite of change of administrations of the US. ",China
170125,President Xi Jinping Speaks with U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump on the Phone,"On the evening of January 17, President Xi Jinping took a phone call from U.S. President-Elect Donald J. Trump.

President Xi congratulated Trump on his reelection as President of the United States. President Xi noted that they both attach great importance to their interactions, and both hope for a good start of the China-U.S. relationship during the new U.S. presidency. President Xi expressed his readiness to secure greater progress in China-U.S. relations from a new starting point.

President Xi stressed that the two great nations of China and the United States are pursuing their respective dreams, and are both committed to delivering a better life to their people. Given the extensive common interests and broad space of cooperation between the two countries, China and the United States can become partners and friends, contribute to each other’s success, and advance shared prosperity for the good of the two countries and the whole world.

President Xi pointed out that it is natural for two big countries with different national conditions to have some disagreements. The important thing is to respect each other’s core interests and major concerns, and find a proper solution. The Taiwan question concerns China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. side needs to approach it with prudence. The bilateral economic ties are essentially mutually beneficial and win-win. Confrontation and conflict should not be an option for the two countries. The two sides should follow the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, work more closely together, do more big, practical and good things that benefit the two countries and the world, and keep the two giant ships of China and the United States sailing forward along the route of steady, sound and sustainable development.

President-Elect Trump thanked President Xi for the congratulations, and said he values his great relations with President Xi. He hoped they would keep talking to each other, and looked forward to meeting with President Xi soon. As the most important countries in the world, the United States and China should get along well for years and beyond and work together for world peace.

Wang Huning said that under the strong leadership of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese people are working together to advance Chinese modernization. China's domestic and foreign policies are consistent and aboveboard. President Xi Jinping put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and identified the four red lines that brook no challenge, namely, the Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China's path and system, and China's development right, providing fundamental strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations. China's policy toward the United States has remained consistent and stable. Noting that the Thucydides Trap is not a historical inevitability, he added that China and the United States should strengthen dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, help each other succeed through cooperation, and work together to cope with various global challenges.

121224,Xi Jinping Sends Congratulatory Letter to U.S.-China Business Council Gala 2024,"On December 11, 2024, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) Gala 2024, in which he extended congratulations to the USCBC and all its members, and sincere greetings to people from all sectors of society in the United States (U.S.) who have long cared for and supported China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation.

Xi Jinping pointed out that China-U.S. relations are among the most important bilateral relations in the world. It concerns not only the vital interests of the two peoples, but also the future of mankind. China and the United States stand to benefit from cooperation and lose from confrontation. The two countries should choose dialogue over confrontation and win-win cooperation over zero-sum games. China is ready to maintain communication with the United States, expand cooperation, manage differences, and continue exploring the right way for the two countries to get along with each other in the new era, so as to realize long-term peaceful coexistence between the two countries on this planet to the benefit of both countries and the world at large.

Xi Jinping stressed that China-U.S. economic and trade relations are an important part of bilateral relations. The interests of the two countries are closely intertwined, and the room for cooperation is infinitely vast. The two sides should properly handle differences through equal-footed consultation, and make the pie of cooperation bigger based on their complementary advantages. The success of one side should be an opportunity rather than a challenge for the other, and one's development should help rather than hinder the development of the other.

Xi Jinping pointed out that openness is a key driving force for human civilization and progress, and the only path toward prosperity and development for every country. Reform and opening up is a historic process in which China and the world achieve development and progress together. A few months ago, the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a comprehensive plan for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. China will always uphold the basic state policy of opening up to the outside world, keep improving its market-oriented, law-based, and world-class business environment for companies from all countries including the United States, and continue to liberalize and facilitate trade and investment. Chinese modernization, with its new achievements, will provide new opportunities for the world. Xi Jinping expressed the hope that USCBC and friends from all sectors will continue to care for and support China-U.S. relations, take an active part in Chinese modernization, join hands to write a new chapter of openness, cooperation and mutual benefit, and make new contributions to the steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations.

171124,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. President Joe Biden in Lima,"On the afternoon of November 16 local time, President Xi Jinping met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Lima.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that over the past four years, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs, but the two sides have also been engaged in dialogue and cooperation. The relationship has remained stable on the whole. Under the stewardship of the two Presidents, the two teams have worked out through consultations a number of guiding principles for China-U.S. relations. The two Presidents have jointly brought China-U.S. dialogue and cooperation back on track. More than 20 communication mechanisms have been restarted or established, and positive achievements have been made in such areas as diplomacy, security, economy, trade, fiscal affairs, finance, military, counternarcotics, law enforcement, agriculture, climate change, and people-to-people exchange.

President Xi underscored that it is worthwhile to review the experiences of the past four years and draw inspirations from them. He listed the following:

First, it is important to have a correct strategic perception. The Thucydides’s Trap is not a historical inevitability. A new Cold War should not be fought and cannot be won. Containing China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail.

Second, it is important to match words with actions. A man cannot establish himself without credibility. China has always honored its words. If the U.S. side always says one thing but does another, it will be detrimental to its own image, and undermine trust between China and the United States.

Third, it is important to treat each other as equals. As two major countries, neither China nor the United States should seek to remodel the other according to one’s own will, suppress the other from the so-called “position of strength,” or deprive the other of the legitimate right to development so as to maintain its leading status.

Fourth, it is important not to challenge red lines and paramount principles. Contradictions and differences between two major countries like China and the United States are unavoidable. But one side should not undermine the core interests of the other, let alone seek conflict or confrontation. The one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués are the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. They must be observed. The Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China’s path and system, and China’s development right are four red lines for China. They must not be challenged. These are the most important guardrails and safety nets for China-U.S. relations.

Fifth, it is important to conduct more dialogue and cooperation. Under the current circumstances, common interests between China and the United States are expanding rather than shrinking. Their cooperation is crucial not only for the economy, trade, agriculture, counternarcotics, law enforcement and public health, but also for handling global challenges of climate change and artificial intelligence (AI) as well as addressing international hotspot issues. The two sides should expand the list of cooperation and make a bigger pie of cooperation to achieve a win-win result.

Sixth, it is important to respond to the expectations of the people. China-U.S. relations should always advance the well-being of the two peoples and bring them closer together. To facilitate personnel and cultural exchange, the two sides need to build bridges and roads, remove distractions and obstacles, and refrain from making any moves that have a chilling effect.

Seventh, it is important to step forward to shoulder the responsibilities of major countries. China and the United States should always keep in mind humanity’s future and their responsibilities for world peace, provide public good for the world, and act in a way conducive to global unity, including carrying out constructive interactions, refraining from mutual attrition, and not coercing other countries into taking sides.

President Xi stressed that the trajectory of China-U.S. relations has proved the validity of these experiences and inspirations from the past 45 years of diplomatic ties. When the two countries treat each other as partner and seek common ground while shelving differences, their relationship will make considerable progress. But if they regard each other as rival and pursue vicious competition, they will roil the relationship or even set it back. Humanity is faced with unprecedented challenges in this turbulent world suffering from frequent conflicts. Major-country competition should not be the underlying logic of the times; only solidarity and cooperation can help humanity overcome current difficulties. Neither decoupling nor supply-chain disruption is the solution; common development can only be achieved through mutually beneficial cooperation. “Small yard, high fences” is not what a major country should do; only openness and sharing can advance the well-being of humanity. A stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. China and the United States should keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other, realize long-term, peaceful coexistence on this planet, and inject more certainty and positive energy into the world.

President Xi stressed that China’s goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Its commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Its position of resolutely safeguarding China’s sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. And its desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. China is ready to engage in dialogue, expand cooperation, and manage differences with the United States so as to sustain the hard-won momentum toward stability in China-U.S. relations.

President Xi stated China’s positions on Taiwan, economic and trade ties, science and technology, cybersecurity, the South China Sea, the Ukraine crisis and the Korean Peninsula.

President Xi stressed that cross-Strait peace and stability and “Taiwan independence” separatist activities are irreconcilable as water and fire. If the U.S side cares about maintaining peace across the Taiwan Strait, it is crucial that it sees clearly the true nature of Lai Ching-te and the DPP authorities in seeking “Taiwan independence,” handles the Taiwan question with extra prudence, unequivocally opposes “Taiwan independence,” and supports China’s peaceful reunification.

The Chinese people’s right to development is not to be deprived of or ignored. While all countries need to safeguard their national security, they should not overstretch the national security concept, still less use it as a pretext for malicious moves to constrain and contain other countries.

There is no evidence that supports the irrational claim of the so-called “cyberattacks from China.” China itself is a target of international cyberattacks, and consistently opposes and combats all forms of cyberattacks.

China firmly upholds its territory, sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea. Dialogue and consultation between states concerned is always the best way to manage differences in the South China Sea. The United States should not get involved in bilateral disputes over the relevant islands and reefs of Nansha Qundao, nor should it aid or abet the impulsion to make provocations.

China’s position and actions on the Ukraine issue have always been fair and square. China conducts shuttle diplomacy and mediation to promote peace talks, makes every effort for peace, and strives for deescalation. China does not allow conflict and turmoil to happen on the Korean Peninsula. It will not sit idly by when its strategic security and core interests are under threat.



President Biden stated that the U.S.-China relationship is the most important relationship in the world, not just for the two peoples, but also for the future of the world. The two governments have a responsibility to the two peoples and the world to see that competition does not veer into conflict. In the past four years, the two sides worked together to rebuild channels of communication. The two diplomatic and security teams have often had strategic communications and had candid and in-depth dialogue, which helped the two sides to better understand each other. Particularly since the San Francisco meeting a year ago, the two sides have made tangible progress on mil-to-mil relations, counternarcotics, law enforcement, AI, climate change and people-to-people exchange. The two sides support each other’s bid for hosting the APEC and G20 meetings respectively in 2026. This demonstrates what we can do for the two peoples when we work together. The United States does not seek a new Cold War, it does not seek to change China’s system, its alliances are not targeted against China, it does not support “Taiwan independence,” it does not seek conflict with China, and it does not see its Taiwan policy as a way to compete with China. The U.S. side will stay committed to the one-China policy. The United States is prepared to enhance communication and dialogue with China during the transition period to have a better perception of each other and responsibly manage the differences.

The two Presidents reiterated the seven-point common understandings on the guiding principles for China-U.S. relations, namely treating each other with respect, finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully, maintaining open lines of communication, preventing conflict, upholding the United Nations Charter, cooperating in areas of shared interest, and responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship. The two sides are ready to uphold these principles, continue to stabilize China-U.S. relations, and ensure a smooth transition of the relationship.

The two Presidents spoke positively about the important role of China-U.S. strategic communication, regular contact between the diplomatic and security teams, and dialogue mechanisms on mil-to-mil relations, economic and trade ties, and financial issues. They agreed to maintain the momentum in communication and strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination. The two Presidents reviewed the important progress in dialogue and cooperation on counternarcotics, climate change, AI, and people-to-people exchanges since their San Francisco meeting.

The two Presidents believed that the two sides have had candid and constructive dialogue on AI. The two sides co-sponsored each other’s resolutions at the U.N. General Assembly on AI. They affirmed the need to enhance international cooperation and promote AI for good for all. The two Presidents stressed the need to maintain human control over the decision to use nuclear weapons.

The two Presidents both believed that their meeting has been candid, profound and constructive. They expressed their willingness to stay in contact.

Xi Jinping expressed appreciation for the unremitting efforts made by the NCUSCR to promote exchanges and cooperation between China and the United States in various fields, and extended congratulations to this year's Gala's esteemed honoree William E. Ford.

Xi Jinping pointed out that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relations in the world, bearing on the well-being of the two peoples and the future of mankind. China has always handled its relations with the United States based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and always believes that each country's success presents opportunities for the other. The two countries should serve as a boost to each other's development rather than a hindrance. China is willing to work with the United States as partners and friends, which will not only benefit the two countries but also the world at large.

Xi Jinping stressed that the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was successfully held in July this year, making systematic arrangements for further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. Opening up is a defining feature of Chinese modernization, and China will only open its door even wider to the outside world. China will intensify institutional opening up, continue to build a world-class international business environment, and leverage its super-large market strength and domestic demand potential to create more opportunities for China-U.S. cooperation. Xi Jinping expressed the hope that the NCUSCR and friends from all sectors of society will continue to care about and support China-U.S. relations, continue to actively participate in China's modernization drive and benefit from it, increase visits and exchanges, constantly deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and work together to turn the San Francisco vision into reality, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples and inject more stability and positive energy into the world.

151024,Spokesperson’s Remarks on Report Revealing Truths of US Hyping up of “Volt Typhoon”,"Global Times: We noted China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center, National Engineering Laboratory for Computer Virus Prevention Technology and the 360 Digital Security Group jointly released a report. It revealed that the US has been hyping up the so-called “Volt Typhoon” hacking group and blamed others to cover up cyberattacks it has launched. What’s China’s comment?

Mao Ning: I have also noted the report. Relevant institutions have released two reports before revealing that “Volt Typhoon” is in fact an international ransomware group, and that in order to receive more congressional budgets and government contracts, the US intelligence community and cybersecurity companies have been collaborating to spread disinformation and frame China. The newly-released report further exposed some staggering facts.

First, the US deployed advanced technical methods to frame other countries for launching cyberattacks. It inserted strings in other languages, such as Chinese, to mislead attribution analysis and frame other countries. It is noteworthy that Guam, which the US claimed to be the victim of “Volt Typhoon” cyberattacks, is actually the headquarter of a large number of cyberattacks against China and many Southeast Asian countries launched by the US.

Second, the US is using its advantages on undersea cables to launch massive, systemic cyber surveillance and espionage globally. Ironically, the US rallied some of its allies to issue a joint statement on the occasion of this year’s UN General Assembly, claiming to safeguard the security and resilience of undersea cables.

Third, the US has never stopped cyber theft against its allies, including Germany. In 2022, the US and Europe have established a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, and the US promised to enhance oversight of cyber surveillance activities in Europe in exchange for Europe’s consent to transmitting data to the United States. The US used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to compel major US internet companies to provide access to user data from their servers, and launched indiscriminate surveillance program and data theft against internet users from Germany and other places in the world.

Fourth, some US tech firms have become accomplices of the US government. The US on the one hand smears that other countries have pre-positioned access to launch cyberattacks. Yet on the other hand, the US has pre-positioned access points into Internet equipment products with the help of large Internet companies or equipment suppliers to attack supply chains worldwide. Some tech firms have actively involved themselves in spreading the false narrative about so-called Chinese hacking in order to get more interests .

The facts revealed in the report once again show who is the biggest threat to global cyberspace security. So far, the US government not only turned a blind eye to the report, but also continued to spread disinformation including “Volt Typhoon.”

China condemns such irresponsible moves by the US, and urges the US to immediately stop its cyberattacks globally and stop smearing China by using cybersecurity issues.",China

290924,Building on Past Achievements and Forging Ahead Together Toward a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind,"Mr. President,
Colleagues,

Today, humanity has once again come to a historical crossroads. We are facing a changing and turbulent world. Challenges of insecurity, imbalanced development and ineffective governance are increasingly prominent. Hotspot conflicts, major-country confrontation and geopolitical tensions keep emerging. The future of this planet is becoming a cause for growing concern. Meanwhile, we are also embracing a world full of hope. Multipolarity and globalization have become the unstoppable trend of our times. The aspirations of the Global South nations for modernization has never been stronger. Our stride toward modernization has never been more steadfast.

This institution, the United Nations, embodies the aspirations of people across the world for lasting peace and common prosperity, and bears witness to the glorious journey of the international community coming together in pursuit of progress. President Xi Jinping stressed on multiple occasions that the role of the U.N. should be strengthened, not weakened. Amid global transformation not seen in a century, what China calls for is to follow the trend of the times, keep to the direction of human progress, and make the right choices of history. What China proposes is to uphold peaceful coexistence and put in place a security architecture that ensures enduring stability; uphold openness and inclusiveness and foster a development paradigm that promotes shared prosperity; uphold harmony without uniformity and adopt an approach to civilizations that promotes exchange and mutual learning; and uphold fairness and justice and develop a governance structure that pools strengths for shared benefit.

In today’s world, the security of all countries is tied together. In face of various kinds of global challenges and risks, no one can stay immune or enjoy security alone. Countries need to be guided by a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We should respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, take the legitimate security concerns of others seriously, and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. We should actively explore a path for major countries to coexist in peace, and work for a new type of international relations characterized by mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation.

In today’s world, the development of all countries is deeply integrated. If the rich get richer while the poor remain poor, then “everyone is born equal” would become an empty slogan, and fairness and justice would be even more elusive. Achieving modernization is a legitimate right of the people of all countries, not a prerogative of a few. We should be committed to advancing global modernization, and ensure that no one and no country is left behind on the journey toward modernization. We should advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive globalization, unequivocally oppose unilateralism and protectionism, and help developing countries leap over the development divide, to maintain the vitality of global economic growth.

In today’s world, each civilization has its own strengths. President Xi Jinping pointed out that there is no such thing as a superior or inferior civilization, and civilizations are different only in identity and location. We should respect the diversity of civilizations, and strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning. We should advocate humanity’s common values, namely, peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, refrain from conducting values-oriented diplomacy, and oppose ideology-based confrontation. We should respect each other as equals, and help each other succeed with an inclusive mind.

In today’s world, countries should all enjoy sovereign equality. As a large number of Global South nations are growing with a strong momentum, gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on everything. We should advocate an equal and orderly multipolar world, and see that all countries, regardless of their size, have their own place and role in the multipolar system. We should practice true multilateralism, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and make international relations more democratic. We should follow the principle of extensive consultation and joint contribution for shared benefit, and make global governance more just and equitable.

Mr. President,

Peace is the most precious thing in our world today. You may wonder if there is a path leading to peace. In fact, peace is the path. Without peace, development will not sustain; without peace, cooperation cannot happen. For the sake of peace, a single ray of hope is reason enough not to give up; the slightest chance deserves a hundredfold effort.

An end to the Ukraine crisis remains elusive. The top priority is to commit to “no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no provocation by any party,” and push for deescalation of the situation as soon as possible. China is committed to playing a constructive role, engaging in shuttle mediation and promoting talks for peace, not throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains. At this session of the General Assembly, China, Brazil and other Global South countries have jointly launched the group of Friends for Peace. Its very purpose is to uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, build consensus for a political settlement of the crisis and contribute to a prospect of peace.

The question of Palestine is the biggest wound to human conscience. As we speak, the conflict in Gaza is still going on, causing more civilian casualties with each passing day. Fighting has spread to Lebanon; might must not take the place of justice. Palestine’s long-held aspiration to establish an independent state should not be shunned anymore, and the historical injustice suffered by the Palestinian people should not be ignored any longer. There must not be any delay in reaching a comprehensive ceasefire, and the fundamental way out lies in the two-State solution. China has always been a staunch supporter of the just cause of the Palestinian people to regain their legitimate national rights, and a staunch supporter of Palestine’s full U.N. membership. We have recently helped to bring about breakthroughs in intra-Palestine reconciliation, and will continue to work in concert with like-minded countries for a comprehensive and just settlement of the question of Palestine and durable peace and security in the Middle East.

The issue of Afghanistan concerns regional peace and security. It is important to help Afghanistan exercise prudent governance, fight terrorism effectively, improve people’s life and reinvigorate the economy, to open up a better future for the Afghan people.

The Korean Peninsula should not experience war again. The important thing is to make persistent effort for deescalation, commit to seeking solutions through dialogue and consultation, realize a transition from the armistice to a peace mechanism, and safeguard peace and stability on the Peninsula.

China is deeply aware that Asia needs stability and development and opposes division and conflict. As an important origin of human civilization and a key engine of global growth, Asia has the wisdom and capability to stabilize the situation through regional cooperation and handle differences properly through dialogue and consultation. We are firmly against the meddling by countries outside the region, and will resolutely resist attempts by any force to stoke trouble and confrontation in the region.

Mr. President,

As the world faces increasingly serious challenges, China has never opted to be an indifferent spectator. Instead, we have been playing a bigger part in global governance than ever before. President Xi Jinping has put forth the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative in recent years. They carry China’s wisdom for resolving various difficult issues confronting humanity, and bring impetus from China for improving global governance.

In the face of uneven and inadequate global development, China’s proposal is to put development at the top of the global agenda, focus on delivering the Sustainable Development Goals of the U.N. 2030 Agenda, increase input in development, and help developing countries better respond to different risks and challenges. At the recent Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, President Xi Jinping outlined 10 partnership actions to be taken together with Africa to advance modernization, and announced the decision to give over 40 LDCs, including those in Africa, zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent tariff lines. China is the first major developing country and the first major economy to take such a significant step.

In the face of unilateral, bullying acts such as sanctions and blockade, China firmly supports countries in defending their legitimate rights, upholding the equity and openness of the international system, making global development more coordinated and beneficial for all, and jointly opposing technology blockade and rejecting decoupling or severing supply chains. Sanctions and pressure will not bring monopolistic advantages. Suppressing and containing others will not solve problems at home. The right of people of all countries to pursue a better life should not be taken away. Here, we once again urge the United States to completely lift its blockade, sanctions and terrorism-related designation against Cuba.

In the face of aggravating ecological challenges, China is firmly committed to a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development. We will move from carbon peaking to carbon neutrality in the shortest time span in world history, contributing China’s efforts to harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature. At the global level, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and the Paris Agreement must be implemented in earnest. Developed countries should assist developing countries in building their capacity to cope with climate change. Touting the need of climate response while suppressing the green industries of others will only hold back global progress in green transition.

In the face of burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI), China is committed to taking a people-centered approach, developing AI for good, and putting equal emphasis on development and security. We are working to explore and establish widely-recognized international rules and standards. China supports the U.N.’s role as the main channel for global AI governance and is committed to strengthening international cooperation on AI capacity-building. China has put forth the AI Capacity-Building Action Plan for Good and for All, and is ready to make more contributions to the sound, orderly, fair and inclusive development of AI.

In the face of the task of human rights protection, China maintains that all countries’ right to independently choose their path of human rights development should be respected. No country should impose its own will on others, or arbitrarily interfere in others’ internal affairs citing human rights as an excuse. In human rights protection, China is committed to putting people first and promoting the free and well-rounded development of the people. We have found a path of human rights development that suits China’s national conditions. China is ready to engage in dialogue and exchanges with all countries and U.N. human rights bodies on an equal footing, and jointly promote the sound development of the global human rights cause.

Mr. President,

Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. This is the history and the reality. Both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan had stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China, and this constitutes an important part of the post-war international order. Right here in this august hall 53 years ago, the 26th session of the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority, deciding to restore all the rights of the People’s Republic of China at the U.N., to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the U.N., and to expel forthwith the representatives of the Taiwan region from the U.N. and all the organizations related to it. Once and for all, the resolution resolved the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, in the U.N. It made clear that there is no such thing as “two Chinas,” or “one China, one Taiwan.” On this matter of principle, there is no gray zone or room for ambiguity. The complete reunification of China will be achieved. Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one and no force can stop.

Mr. President,

In a few days’ time, the People’s Republic of China will celebrate the 75th anniversary of its founding. Over the past 75 years, no matter how the world changes, China’s dedication has not changed. It is dedicated to pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is also dedicated to human progress and world harmony. In the course of seeking its own development, China has kept in mind the common interests of the whole world, generating new opportunities for the world through its own development. Not long ago, the Third Plenum of the 20th CPC Central Committee made an important decision on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. It set in motion a new journey where China joins hands with the world in common development and progress.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to world peace and stability. The Chinese culture values peace, and the Chinese nation has no tradition of external expansion. China, once a victim of foreign power bullying, knows full well the value of peace and the hard-won gains of development. In fact, China is the only major country that has written peaceful development into its constitution, and the only country among the five nuclear-weapon states to pledge no-first-use of nuclear weapons. We are actively exploring and putting into practice the Chinese way of addressing hotspot issues, boosting the prospects for resolving the security dilemma and improving security governance, and paving the ground for conflict settlement and peacebuilding. Every step in China’s development is an increase in the force for peace.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to the common development for all. China does not only care about its own development. We are ready to develop hand in hand with all countries. By further expanding high-standard opening up, China is aligning proactively with high-standard international economic and trade rules to foster a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment. China has realized full mutual visa exemption with many countries, and is expanding its unilateral visa waiver program to facilitate two-way personnel flows. China is vigorously promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, a concrete step to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China will also speed up the implementation of the eight measures in support of Global South cooperation and the series of initiatives supporting Africa’s peace and development, in order to help countries in the Global South stride toward modernization.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to improving global governance. China has been an abiding supporter of the U.N.’s continued reform and development to bring about a modernized “U.N. 2.0.” The international financial system needs to be more fit for the times and global governance should be more balanced and effective. China will continue to fulfill its international obligations, provide financial support and send our best minds to the United Nations. The U.N. system needs to respond to the legitimate calls of developing countries and increase the representation and voice of those in the Global South.

Chinese modernization will contribute robustly to the advancement of human civilization. Chinese modernization is rooted in China, but has also drawn on the achievements of other civilizations. It has created a new form of human advancement, and provided a new choice to other countries in exploring modernization paths. China believes that different civilizations should respect and learn from one another, and jointly contribute to the progress of human civilization. China has proposed the setting up of an International Day for Dialogue among Civilizations. We call for more people-to-people exchanges and cooperation across the world, to strengthen mutual understanding and amity among people of all countries.

Mr. President,

Next year will mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of this very Organization. China stands ready to work with all countries to renew the founding purposes and mission of the U.N., reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the U.N. Charter, advocate and practice true multilateralism, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and jointly usher in a better world.

Thank you.",China
280924,Wang Yi Meets with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On September 27, 2024 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken upon request on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Wang Yi pointed out that under the strategic guidance of the two Presidents, China-U.S. relations have, amid twists and turns, returned to Bali and reached San Francisco. Such progress is hard-won and should be cherished. The stabilization of China-U.S. relations serves the interests of the two peoples and meets the expectation of the international community. Whether or not this momentum can be sustained depends on the efforts of both sides. The United States should not always approach China with two faces: On the one hand encircling and suppressing China brazenly, and on the other hand, having dialogue and cooperation with China as if nothing is wrong. Since the United States has expressed multiple times that it has no intention to have conflict with China, then fundamentally, it needs to establish a rational perception of China, and find the right way to get along with it. The United States needs to carry out dialogue with respect, advance cooperation in the spirit of reciprocity, and address differences with great prudence, rather than act willfully as it sees fit from a position of strength or use previous mistakes as excuses to make more mistakes.



Wang Yi underscored that the intensifying ""Taiwan independence"" activities by Lai Ching-te and others pose the greatest danger to the situation across the Taiwan Strait. ""Taiwan independence"" and cross-Strait peace are irreconcilable. If the United States truly hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle, implement the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, stop arming Taiwan, publicly oppose ""Taiwan independence,"" and support the peaceful reunification of China.

Wang Yi said that China is firmly opposed to U.S. suppression in trade and technology. National security should not be politicized, and ""small yard, high fence"" should not become ""big yard, iron curtain."" China will never accept finger-pointing by human rights preachers, still less interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. People-to-people exchanges between the two countries are very important, and the United States should remove obstacles with real actions.

Wang Yi articulated China's firm position on the South China Sea issue. He stressed that China remains committed to resolving differences through dialogue and consultation with countries directly concerned. The United States should not stir up trouble in the South China Sea, or undermine regional countries' efforts to safeguard peace and stability there.

Wang Yi noted that China's position on the Ukraine issue is aboveboard. It has been committed to promoting talks for peace and has been making its efforts toward peaceful settlement. The United States should stop smearing, scapegoating and arbitrarily imposing sanctions on China, and stop using this issue to create antagonism and incite camp-based confrontation.

The two sides agreed that the meeting was candid and substantive, and that China and the United States need to find a way to live alongside one another in peace in the indefinite future. The two sides will continue to implement the important common understandings of the two Presidents in San Francisco, engage in dialogue and cooperation, and properly manage differences to work toward stable, healthy and sustainable development of bilateral relations.

The two sides agreed to maintain communication on international and regional hotspot issues, and hold a new round of consultations on Asia-Pacific affairs in due course.",China
270924,"Working Together for Peace, Development and a Brighter Future for BRICS","Dear colleagues,

It is a great pleasure to meet you all in New York.

The current international situation is marked by change and instability, and the world is experiencing disorder, slowing growth, uneven development, and a loss of focus in governance. The theme of this year’s General Debate—“Leaving no one behind”—highlights the widely shared aspiration for greater equality, security and prosperity in our world. As leading members of the Global South, we BRICS countries should pursue our own success while promoting the greater good, and make our contribution to an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization.

—We should promote common security and strive for lasting peace. In today’s world where countries are dependent on each other, humanity live in an inseparable community of security. No country has the right to manipulate the global security agenda or seek its own security at the expense of others. It is important that we make good use of such BRICS mechanisms as the Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs / International Relations and the Meeting of National Security Advisers and High Representatives on National Security to strengthen coordination on international and regional hotspots and make a joint response to the various challenges we face. On Ukraine, we should uphold the principles of no expansion of the battlefield, no escalation of fighting and no fanning the flames by any party, and encourage dialogue and negotiation for the settlement of the crisis. The six-point common understanding jointly released by Brazil and China to this end has received varying degrees of positive response from over 100 countries. On Palestine, China stands firmly with Arab countries. We must push for the early realization of a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza, support Palestine’s full U.N. membership, and implement the two-State solution, in a bid to bring enduring peace to the Middle East.

—We should stay focused on development as a priority and remove hinderance to development. Development is an eternal pursuit of humanity and a major yardstick of the progress of times. The Global Development Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping has received active support from the U.N. and a vast number of developing countries. BRICS should harness its strengths to drive development to the center of the U.N. agenda, stay attentive to the difficulties facing developing countries, urge developed countries to honor their promises, and give a stronger boost to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is important to keep in mind the urgent needs of developing countries in poverty reduction, development financing, and energy and food security, and seize the opportunities presented by the technological revolution and industrial transformation to foster new drivers for high-quality development.

—We should follow true multilateralism and improve global governance. When multilateralism is under attack, the world will be in disarray. When hegemonic and bullying acts run unchecked, human civilization will revert to the law of the jungle. It is important that we firmly defend the international system with the U.N. at its core, uphold the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and reject a selective application of these purposes and principles. We could take the follow-up to the Summit of the Future as a chance to advance the reform of the international financial architecture, support countries of the South in participating fully in international economic decision-making, governance and rules-making, and increase their voice and representation. “Enhancing International Cooperation on Capacity-Building of Artificial Intelligence,” the resolution cosponsored by China and many other countries of the South, has been overwhelmingly adopted at the General Assembly. We welcome BRICS countries on board for its implementation so that more developing countries can benefit from it.

Colleagues,

Next month, BRICS will hold its first summit following its membership expansion. All eyes will be on this highly significant meeting. We should support Russia’s chairmanship, and take the summit as an opportunity to send a strong message of upholding fairness and justice and promoting common development. We could strive for new milestone outcomes in such areas as finance, AI, and energy and minerals to get the greater  BRICS cooperation off to a good start. We should also step up efforts to set up the Partner Country category, which is a consensus reached by BRICS leaders at the Johannesburg Summit last year and a mission we must accomplish. We need to keep the door open to new members, so as to provide more vigor and drive to the development of BRICS.

Colleagues,

Not long ago, the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its third plenary session. At the session, a new blueprint was drawn up to further advance Chinese modernization. As China pursues high-standard opening up and high-quality development, we will continue to view fellow BRICS countries as good companions and good partners. China will share development opportunities with BRICS countries and other countries around the world and seek more cooperation in building a community with a shared future for mankind.

Thank you.",China

Peng Liyuan had a warm interaction with the teenager delegation from Washington State, the United States. She welcomed the teachers and students to visit, know about and experience the real China firsthand, and expressed the expectation for more mutual understanding and interaction between teenagers from China and the United States to inject positive energy into China-U.S. relations.



Peng Liyuan, together with the Chinese and foreign guests, watched a friendly basketball match between Chinese and U.S. teenagers, and she presented commemorative medals to players from both teams. The student cheerleading squads from both countries performed vibrant aerobics, earning rounds of applause from the audience.





Peng Liyuan watched a video of the U.S. teenager delegation's visit to China. The U.S. student representatives enthusiastically shared their unforgettable experiences and impressions from visiting various provinces and cities in China, learning about different ethnic customs, and experiencing outstanding traditional Chinese culture. Logic Seven Allah-Amen, Assistant Principal at Lincoln High School, fondly recalled hosting the visit of President Xi Jinping and Professor Peng Liyuan to the school in 2015, and sincerely thanked President Xi Jinping for his care and support for exchanges between the teenagers of both countries. He also expressed willingness to actively contribute to promoting a closer bond between the two peoples.

290824,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan,"On the afternoon of August 29, President Xi Jinping met with Assistant to the U.S. President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

President Xi pointed out that in this changing and turbulent world, countries need solidarity and coordination, not division or confrontation. People want openness and progress, not exclusion or regress. As two major countries, China and the United States should be responsible for history, for the people and for the world, and should be a source of stability for world peace and a propeller for common development.

President Xi stressed that when China and the United States, two major countries, engage with each other, the No.1 issue is to develop a right strategic perception, and they need to first and foremost find a good answer to the overarching question: Are China and the United States rivals or partners? China’s foreign policy is open and transparent and its strategic intentions are aboveboard, both of which have been highly consistent and stable. China is focused on managing its own affairs well and will continue deepening reform comprehensively to further improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics that suits China’s national conditions. China follows a path of peaceful development. While realizing its own development, China is also ready to work with other countries for common development, and to jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind.

President Xi pointed out that China’s U.S. policy is highly consistent. While great changes have taken place in the two countries and in China-U.S. relations, China’s commitment to the goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged, its principle in handling the relationship based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation remains unchanged, its position of firmly safeguarding the country’s sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged, and its efforts to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people remain unchanged. President Xi expressed the hope that the United States will work in the same direction with China, view China and its development in a positive and rational light, see each other’s development as an opportunity rather than a challenge, work with China to find a right way for China and the United States, two countries with different civilizations, systems and paths, to coexist in peace and achieve common development on this planet, and work to maintain the stability of China-U.S. relations and, on that basis, improve and take forward the relationship.



National Security Advisor Sullivan conveyed the regards of President Biden to President Xi, and thanked President Xi for meeting him. He said that since the San Francisco summit meeting between the two presidents, the two sides have earnestly implemented their common understandings and achieved positive progress. This round of strategic communication with Director Wang Yi in China was in-depth, candid, substantive and constructive. He reiterated that the United States does not seek a new Cold War, it does not seek to change China’s system, the revitalization of U.S. alliances is not against China, the United States does not support “Taiwan independence,” and it does not seek conflict with China. The one-China policy of the United States has not changed, and it has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to contain China. The United States hopes to maintain strategic communication with China and find a way for the United States and China to coexist in peace and for U.S.-China relations to develop in a sustainable way. President Biden looks forward to having communication again with President Xi soon.

President Xi asked National Security Advisor Sullivan to pass on his regards to President Biden. President Xi expressed readiness to stay in touch with President Biden to guide and steer the development of China-U.S. relations.

280824,Wang Yi and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan Hold Strategic Communication,"From August 27 to 28, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi held a new round of strategic communication with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Beijing. The two sides had candid, substantive and constructive discussions.

Wang Yi said, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs. Reviewing the experiences and lessons from these fluctuations can help forge a better future and find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other.

First, to keep China-U.S. relations on the right track, the key is to rely on the guidance of the two heads of state. The two sides should uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation and implement the common understandings reached between the two heads of state to promote the stable, sound and sustainable development of bilateral relations.

Second, to avoid conflict and confrontation between China and the United States, the key is to adhere to the three China-U.S. joint communiques. The political foundation for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries must be maintained. China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, its political system and development path, and the legitimate right to development of the Chinese people must be respected.

Third, to ensure smooth China-U.S. interactions, the key is to treat each other as equals. Acting from a position of strength is not the right way of interaction between countries.

Fourth, the key to pursuing the steady, sustained development of China-U.S. relations is cementing public support. The two countries should build more bridges and pave more roads for people-to-people exchange, rather than raising obstacles.

Fifth, to achieve peaceful coexistence between China and the United States, the key is to establish correct perception. China is committed to ensuring better lives for its people at home, and to making greater contributions to world peace and development. The United States should not speculate about China based on its own historical path, nor should it assume that China will follow the path taken by past world powers that sought hegemony.



Wang Yi briefed Jake Sullivan on the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee, and stressed that the meeting marks a new milestone in China's reform and opening-up, providing a new window for the outside world to understand China and new opportunities for the common development of all countries.

Wang Yi stressed that Taiwan belongs to China and that China will be reunited. ""Taiwan independence"" poses the biggest risk to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The United States should act on its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"", adhere to the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques, stop arming Taiwan, and support the peaceful reunification of China.

Wang Yi pointed out that national security should be common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, and one country's security should not be built upon the insecurity of others. National security requires clear boundaries, particularly in the economic domain, where they must be scientifically defined. Wang Yi urged the United States to end its suppression of China in the economic, trade and sci-tech fields, and refrain from undermining China's legitimate interests. Using ""overcapacity"" as an excuse to pursue protectionism will only harm global green development and impede world economic growth.

Wang Yi stressed that China is firm in upholding its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests over the Nanhai Zhudao (South China Sea islands), as well as the seriousness and efficacy of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. The United States must not undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity under the pretext of bilateral treaties, nor should it support or condone the Philippines' acts of infringement.



Jake Sullivan said that there are differences and competition between the United States and China, but also many areas where cooperation is needed. He noted that the United States agrees that the two countries should treat each other as equals and that competition should be healthy and fair, and said the U.S. side has no intention of decoupling from China. The United States adheres to the one-China policy and does not support ""Taiwan independence"", ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"". The United States and China will coexist peacefully on this planet for a long time, and the goal of U.S. policy is to find a way to make the U.S.-China relationship sustainable. The U.S. side is willing to continue maintaining strategic communication with China to enhance mutual understanding and reduce misunderstanding and miscalculation.

The two sides also had an exchange of views on issues concerning Ukraine, the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula. Reiterating that China is always committed to promoting peace talks and pushing for a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, Wang Yi said that China will continue to do the right thing. The United States should not shift responsibility to China, even less impose illegal, unilateral sanctions.

The two sides discussed a new round of interactions between the two heads of state in the near future. The two sides agreed to continue implementing the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state at their San Francisco summit meeting, and maintain high-level exchange and communication at all levels. They also agreed to continue carrying out cooperation on drug control, law enforcement, the repatriation of illegal immigrants and climate change response. The two sides agreed on institutional arrangements such as a video call between theater leaders of the two militaries, and the second round of China-U.S. governmental talks on AI at an appropriate time.",China
250824,MFA official's briefing on U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan's visit to China,"The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) announced on Saturday that Assistant to the U.S. President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) Jake Sullivan will visit China from August 27 to 29 at the invitation of Wang Yi, Member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission, to hold a new round of China-U.S. strategic communication. In a press briefing on Sunday, the leading official of MFA's Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs gave further information and took questions from the media.

The leading official said that holding strategic communication between the Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission Office and the National Security Advisor to the U.S. President was an important consensus reached between the Chinese and U.S. presidents at their Bali meeting in November 2022. Since the meeting, Director Wang Yi and NSA Sullivan have held three rounds of strategic communication in Vienna, Malta and Bangkok respectively, all of which were substantive and constructive, and produced good results. Both sides agreed to continue making good use of this channel of strategic communication.

The upcoming visit will also be the first visit to China by a National Security Advisor to the U.S. President after eight years, and the first visit to China by NSA Sullivan. It is an important step for the two sides to implement the common understandings the two presidents reached at their San Francisco meeting. After San Francisco, the diplomatic, financial, law enforcement and climate teams and the militaries of the two sides have maintained communication, and the exchanges between the two peoples have increased. Meanwhile, the United States has kept containing and suppressing China. And China has taken resolute countermeasures. The China-U.S. relationship is still at a critical juncture of being stabilized.

Against this backdrop, Director Wang Yi will have an in-depth exchange of views with NSA Sullivan on China-U.S. relations, sensitive issues, and major international and regional hotspots. The two sides will jointly take stock of the progress made by the two countries in implementing the common understandings of the two presidents in San Francisco, give full play to the 20-plus dialogue and communication mechanisms that have been established or resumed, and continue to discuss the issue of strategic perception and the boundary between national security and economic activities. The Chinese side will focus on raising serious concerns, articulating its position and laying out serious demands on issues related to the Taiwan question, the right to development and China's strategic security. The Taiwan question is the first and foremost red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations, and ""Taiwan independence"" is the biggest risk to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. side must abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and honor its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence."" The U.S. side's continuous arbitrary measures against China in the areas of tariffs, export control, investment review and unilateral sanctions seriously undermine China's legitimate rights and interests. China demands that the U.S. side stop turning economic and trade issues into political and security issues. As the foundation of the China-U.S. relationship lies in grassroots connections, the United States should work in the same direction with China and take more measures to facilitate the flow of people between the two countries. China will also urge the United States to fulfill its responsibilities as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and play a constructive role for the political settlement of major, salient international and regional issues, not the contrary.

The leading official emphasized that China's U.S. policy is consistent, which is underpinned by the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forward by China. These principles are the lessons learned from the 50-plus years of China-U.S. relations as well as the conflicts between major countries in history. China and the United States should put in a lot of efforts to follow them. China has all along believed that major-country competition is not the solution to the problems facing the United States or the world.

The leading official also took questions from the media. On Ukraine, the official said that China's position is aboveboard, and it will continue to promote peace talks, work for political settlement and carry out mediation diplomacy. The United States should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and stop smearing, framing, pressuring and blackmailing China. China will continue to take strong and resolute measures to safeguard its major interests and legitimate rights.

On the South China Sea issue, the leading official emphasized that China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the region have sufficient historical and legal basis, and that countries in the region have full confidence, wisdom and capability to properly handle the issue. Countries outside the region should not do things that provoke confrontation or increase tensions.

The leading official pointed out that on the Middle East issue, China is committed to promoting peace and justice and supports all parties in safeguarding their legitimate rights and interests, especially the restoration of the legitimate national rights of Palestine. The immediate priority is that all parties to the conflict must earnestly implement the relevant Security Council resolutions and create conditions for an early comprehensive and lasting ceasefire in Gaza. The international community should pool their efforts to this end. It is hoped that the United States will heed the voices of the majority of the international community and adopt a responsible position.

Responding to the U.S.'s unwarranted accusation that China is a threat to the international order, the leading official said that China's development is an important part of human progress and an inevitable trend in the evolution of history. China does not follow the old path of Western colonization and plundering, nor the wrong path of seeking hegemony with growing strength. Nor does it seek to export its ideology. China is committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation, and is a firm defender of the U.N.-Centered international system and international order, which contributes to the force for peace and the stabilizing factors in today's world.",China

270724,Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu Attends the US-China Business Council Event Commemorating the 45th Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the United States,"On July 26, 2024, Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu attended and delivered a speech at the US-China Business Council event commemorating the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States upon invitation.

Ma Zhaoxu said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations 45 years ago, China-U.S. relations have gone through ups and downs, but have always moved forward. On January 1 this year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, emphasizing the commitment to stabilizing and developing the bilateral relationship for the benefits of both countries and the world. The three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping are the fundamental guidelines for China in handling its relationship with the United States. China and the United States should respect each other's social systems and development paths, and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs, obstructing or containing each other's development, or undermining each other's core interests. Confrontation has no way out, the ""new Cold War"" has no winner, and cooperation is the only correct choice for the two countries. China is firmly determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, and no external force can stop China's development and growth.

Ma Zhaoxu pointed out that the Resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee has drawn a grand blueprint for China to further deepen reform comprehensively, which will not only greatly advance Chinese modernization, but also create broader space for the development of enterprises from various countries, including the United States, in China. He hoped that the United States will work with China in the same direction, earnestly implement the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state at the San Francisco Summit meeting, establish a correct understanding, strengthen practical cooperation, deepen cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and promote the steady and long-term development of China-U.S. relations.",China

The two sides exchanged views on current China-U.S. relations, and agreed to maintain communication at all levels and further implement the important common understandings reached by their Presidents at the San Francisco meeting.

Wang Yi said that in the past three months, the diplomatic, financial, law enforcement, and climate teams of the two governments and the two militaries have maintained communication, and people-to-people exchanges have been on the rise. However it must be pointed out that the U.S. has not stopped, but rather doubled down on its containment and suppression of China. The risks facing China-U.S. relations are still building, and the challenges rising. The relationship remains at a critical juncture of deescalation and stabilization. We need to continue to recalibrate the direction, manage risks, properly address differences, remove interference, and advance cooperation.

Wang Yi said that China's U.S. policy is consistent, and adheres to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. The U.S. side should earnestly implement the commitments made by President Biden, and return to a rational and pragmatic China policy. The two sides need to work together for a stable, healthy, and sustainable China-U.S. relationship.

Wang Yi pointed out that the U.S. side holds a wrong perception of China, always seeing China with its own hegemonic mindset. China is not the United States, nor does China want to become like the United States. China does not pursue hegemony, or practice power politics. China has the best record on peace and security among all major countries. The third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee adopted a major resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization. We will stay committed to our founding aspiration, and focus on seeking happiness for the Chinese people, and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. China will stay on the path of peaceful development, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. It is hoped that the U.S. side will better understand the CPC as well as China's present and future through this resolution.



Wang Yi said that Taiwan is part of China, and it never has been and never will be a country. “Taiwan independence” and cross-Strait peace are as irreconcilable as fire and water. Each time “Taiwan independence” forces make provocation, we will definitely take countermeasures. We will keep reducing the space for “Taiwan independence” and work toward the goal of complete reunification.

Wang Yi reiterated the ins and outs of the Ren'ai Jiao (Reef) issue. Now that China has agreed on a provisional arrangement with the Philippines on managing the situation, the Philippine side should honor its commitment, and not ship construction materials any more. The U.S. side should not take any more action to fan the flames, stir up trouble, or undermine maritime stability.

Wang Yi said that China's position on the Ukraine issue is fair and transparent, and China will continue to encourage and promote peace talks. The U.S. side should stop abusing unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction. China rejects false accusations, and will not succumb to pressure or blackmail. China will take resolute and robust measures to protect its major interests and legitimate rights.



Blinken said that the United States is strongly committed to stabilizing U.S.-China relations and continues to follow the one-China policy. The U.S. side looks forward to keeping in regular communication with the Chinese side and continuing the cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics and artificial intelligence. The U.S. would like to manage differences between the two sides and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.

The two sides also exchanged views on the situation concerning Gaza and the Korean Peninsula, and the question of Myanmar, among other matters.",China
220724,Wang Yi Holds a Group Meeting with Delegation of the U.S.-China Business Council Board of Directors,"On July 22, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a group meeting with the delegation of the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) Board of Directors in Beijing.

Wang Yi welcomed the representatives of the U.S. business community for their visit to China. Noting that the USCBC celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, Wang Yi said that President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter fully affirming the USCBC's work and encouraging the USCBC to build more bridges of friendly exchanges between China and the United States, forge more bonds of practical cooperation, and contribute to writing a new chapter of win-win cooperation between China and the United States in the next 50 years.

Wang Yi said, the just-concluded Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee is an important meeting that attracted worldwide attention with historic significance. He said, ""As the first delegation from the U.S. business community to visit China after the plenum, you can feel the new atmosphere of China's further deepening reform comprehensively from the first time, making your visit a highly timely one."" A review of China's development history shows that China has made great strides to catch up with the times thanks to its reform and opening up. After the 18th CPC National Congress, China has successfully achieved its first centenary goal, also as a result of reform and opening up. Now to usher in a new phase of Chinese modernization and achieve the second centenary goal, China still needs to rely on reform and opening up. The Resolution adopted by the plenum has more than 20,000 characters, covering all aspects of promoting Chinese modernization, and offers a panoramic view of further deepening reform comprehensively. The Resolution lays out more than 300 important reform tasks, and makes it clear that all of them shall be completed by the time the People's Republic of China celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2029, which will provide a solid guarantee for Chinese modernization.

Wang Yi further introduced the important measures in the Resolution on deepening reform, especially high-standard opening up, pointing out that China's reform and opening up is guided by principles and has a clear direction, and the overall objectives are to continue to improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize China's system and capacity for governance. Any attempt to change China's social system and development path is futile. China is following the right path chosen by the Chinese people, and will neither copy foreign models nor export the Chinese model. China is ready to strengthen exchanges and integration with other countries on the basis of equality and mutual respect and move forward hand in hand on the path to world modernization.



Wang Yi pointed out that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. Whether China and the United States engage in cooperation or confrontation bears on the well-being of their two peoples and the future of humanity. China has consistently maintained stability and continuity in its policy toward the United States. It has always handled its affairs with the United States in accordance with the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. China is committed to strengthening dialogue, managing differences and expanding cooperation with the United States, so as to stabilize, improve and push forward China-U.S. relations. At the same time, China also has interests, principles and a bottom line that it must safeguard. Wang Yi expressed the hope that the U.S. business community will continue to work hand in hand with China to not only achieve greater development for itself, but also make new contributions to the development of China- U.S. relations and the friendship between the two peoples.

Wang Yi listened carefully to the remarks of the U.S. representatives and responded to each of their concerns.

Wang Yi said, as President Xi Jinping pointed out that for China and the United States, two major countries, turning one's back on another is not an option; it is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other; and conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides. Viewed from the perspective of ""my own country first"", the world is a cramped and crowded place perpetuated in ""fierce competition"". Viewed from the perspective of ""a global community with a shared future"", the world is a vast and broad place full of cooperation opportunities. The earth is broad enough for China and the United States to develop and prosper together. The past 45 years have shown that when the overall environment of China-U.S. relations is favorable, all parties will benefit. In an unfavorable environment, the scope for exchanges and cooperation is inevitably constrained. Wang Yi expressed the hope that the USCBC and its member companies will make full use of their connections and influence, and drawing upon their development experience in China, present a true, multi-dimensional and panoramic view of China to the U.S. government, Congress and all walks of life. He urged them to voice more objective, positive and rational views to promote the right perception of China in the United States, stop suppressing China in economy, trade, science and technology, and effectively resolve the obstacles that hinder people-to-people and cultural exchanges to promote the steady and sound development of China-U.S. relations.

USCBC Board Chair Rajesh Subramaniam, Founder of United Family Healthcare Roberta Lipson, President of Boeing Global Brendan Nelson, CEO of the United States Education Testing Service Amit Sevak, and USCBC President Craig Allen said that they welcome the important signal of further deepening reform comprehensively released by the Third Plenary Session of the 20th CPC Central Committee. The consistency, coherence and stability of the Chinese government's policies are crucial for foreign companies, including those from the United States, to continue to invest and do business in China on a long-term basis. The representatives hope that the plenum will stimulate China's new round of economic reform and further opening up, and attract more sustainable foreign investment. The U.S.-China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world, of which economic and trade relationship is a stabilizing factor. The U.S. business community has confidence in continuing to deepen its cooperation with China and looks forward to further deepening bilateral cooperation in economy, trade, investment, green development, healthcare, education, people-to-people and cultural exchanges and other fields. It is committed to building a strong and balanced U.S.-China relationship, which fully serves the common interests of the two countries and two peoples. The USCBC is ready to actively leverage its influence and role and firmly act as a stabilizing force for the development of U.S.-China relations.",China

060624,Xi Jinping Replies to Letter from President of Kean University Lamont Repollet,"Recently, President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Lamont Repollet, president of Kean University of the United States, encouraging Chinese and American universities to strengthen exchanges and cooperation and contribute to China-U.S. friendship.

Recalling witnessing the signing ceremony of the China-U.S. cooperation agreement on jointly establishing Wenzhou-Kean University in 2006 at Kean University, Xi Jinping said he is pleased to see that with the joint efforts of both sides, Wenzhou-Kean University has achieved remarkable results and become a landmark project in China-U.S. educational cooperation.

Xi Jinping pointed out that China-U.S. relations bear on the well-being of the two peoples and the future of mankind. Educational exchanges and cooperation will help promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples, especially between the youth of the two countries. It is a project for future development of China-U.S. relations. Xi expressed appreciation for what Repollet said in his letter about deepening cooperation with Wenzhou-Kean University and encouraging American students to come to China for exchange and study, and called on universities of the two countries to step up exchanges and cooperation through different modalities to cultivate young envoys who know both countries well, and build more bridges to promote China-U.S. friendship.

In the reply letter, Xi Jinping welcomes Repollet and other members of the American education community to visit China more often, and asked Repollet to convey his regards to Dr. Dawood Farahi, former president of Kean University.

In May 2006, under the care and facilitation of the then Secretary of CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee Xi Jinping, Wenzhou University and Kean University of the United States formally signed an agreement, deciding to jointly establish Wenzhou-Kean University. In 2014, with the approval of the Ministry of Education, Wenzhou-Kean University was officially established.

The Chinese side expressed grave concerns over the U.S. side's infringement and provocative moves in waters off China's coast, and urged the U.S. side to earnestly respect China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, refrain from meddling in maritime disputes between China and its neighbors, refrain from ganging up to ""use the sea to contain China"", and refrain from undermining peace and stability in the region.

The Chinese side emphasized that the one-China principle is the political foundation of China-U.S. relations and an important basis for maritime dialogue between the two sides. ""Taiwan independence"" is the biggest threat undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.

220524,Xi Jinping Sends Letter to the Opening Ceremony of the 14th China-U.S. Tourism Leadership Summit,"On May 22, 2024, President Xi Jinping sent a letter to the opening ceremony of the 14th China-U.S. Tourism Leadership Summit.

Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, Xi Jinping said the foundation of China-U.S. relations is laid by the people, the door of China-U.S. relations is opened by the people, the stories of China-U.S. relations are written by the people, and the future of China-U.S. relations will be jointly created by the people of the two countries.

260424,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On the afternoon of April 26, President Xi Jinping met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

President Xi Jinping noted that this year marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. Over the past 45 years, the relationship has gone through wind and rain, and the two sides can draw a few important lessons: China and the United States should be partners rather than rivals; help each other succeed rather than hurt each other; seek common ground and reserve differences rather than engage in vicious competition; and honor words with actions rather than say one thing but do another. He proposed mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as the three overarching principles for the relationship. They are both lessons learned from the past and a guide for the future.



President Xi Jinping emphasized that in his phone call with President Biden three weeks ago, he shared his thoughts on how to stabilize and develop China-U.S. relations in 2024, and underlined that the two sides should value peace, prioritize stability, and uphold credibility. “The finer details will fall into place when they are aligned with the bigger picture,” he once stressed. The world today is undergoing transformation not seen in a century. How to respond to it is a question of the times and of the world. President Xi’s answer is to build a community with a shared future for mankind, which has become a flag of China’s foreign policy and has been welcomed by many countries. Planet Earth is only this big, and humanity is faced with so many common challenges. As an old Chinese saying goes, “Passengers in the same boat should help each other.” Today, as he sees it, dwellers of the same planet should help each other. We live in an interdependent world and rise and fall together. With their interests deeply intertwined, all countries need to build maximum consensus for win-win and all-win outcomes. This is the basic starting point for China to view the world and the China-U.S. relationship. President Xi underlined his view that major countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and act with broad-mindedness and a sense of responsibility. China and the United States should set an example in this regard, undertake responsibilities for world peace, create opportunities for the development of all countries, provide the world with public goods, and play a positive role in promoting global unity.

President Xi Jinping underscored that in his meeting with President Biden in San Francisco, he proposed five pillars for China-U.S. relations, namely, jointly developing a right perception, jointly managing disagreements effectively, jointly advancing mutually beneficial cooperation, jointly shouldering responsibilities as major countries, and jointly promoting people-to-people exchanges. They should serve as the underpinning for the mansion of China-U.S relations. When the overarching principles are established, specific issues will become easier to address. China is willing to cooperate, but cooperation should be a two-way street. China is not afraid of competition, but competition should be about progressing together instead of playing a zero-sum game. China is committed to non-alliance, and the U.S. should not create small blocs. While each side can have its friends and partners, it should not target, oppose or harm the other. China welcomes a confident, open, prosperous and thriving United States, and hopes the United States will also look at China’s development in a positive light.

President Xi Jinping stressed that as a Chinese saying goes, “No progress means regress.” It also applies to China-U.S. relations. The stabilizing trend in China-U.S. relations did not come by easily. It is hoped that the two teams will continue working actively to follow through on the San Francisco vision he and President Biden reached, so as to truly stabilize, improve and move forward the bilateral relations.



Secretary Blinken conveyed President Biden’s greetings to President Xi. He noted that since President Biden and President Xi met in San Francisco, the U.S. and China have made good progress in their cooperation in such areas as bilateral interactions, counter-narcotics, artificial intelligence and people-to-people exchanges. The multiplicity and complexity of the challenges the world faces require the U.S. and China working together. The Americans from all walks of life that he met during the visit all expressed the hope to see U.S.-China relations improve. The U.S. does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China’s system, does not seek to suppress China’s development, does not seek to revitalize its alliances against China, and has no intention to have a conflict with China. The U.S. adheres to the one-China policy. It hopes to maintain communication with the Chinese side, follow through on what the two presidents agreed in San Francisco, seek more cooperation, avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations, responsibly manage differences, and achieve stable development of U.S.-China relations.

180424,MFA Coordinator for Cyber Affairs Wang Lei Takes an Exclusive Interview with CCTV,"On 15 April 2024, Mr. Wang Lei, Coordinator for Cyber Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs took an exclusive interview with CCTV regarding the report newly released by China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center (CVERC) exposing the truth that the US hypes up the so-called “Volt Typhoon” and launches false allegations against China. The transcript is as follows:

CCTV: The CVERC has just released a report on the so-called “Volt Typhoon” hacker group this morning, exposing a huge scandal of collusive corruption and premeditated false allegations against China by cybersecurity agencies and relevant companies of the US, the largest hacker state. Do you have any comment on this?

Wang Lei: The CVERC has released a new report, uncovering a scandal of how to get budget from the US government by making unscrupulous and baseless accusations against China. The US side has been constantly hyping up the so-called “Volt Typhoon”, with some senior officials claiming that a “PRC-sponsored hacking group” launched cyber attacks against critical infrastructure in Guam and elsewhere in the US.

In response to this accusation, this newly released report has revealed a very important conclusion that the so-called “Volt Typhoon” is actually an international ransomware group. Through collusive corruption and launching false allegations against China, US cybersecurity agencies and relevant companies have gained enormous profits for themselves, and at the same time fueled the irrational elements in the US policy towards China.

Cybersecurity has always been an important and special topic in China-US relationship. The whole world is puzzled at why the US, as the largest hacker state, is constantly hyping up hacking threats from China. We may find an important clue to answer this question through this report.

More concerningly, the US side has for the first time indicated the connection between cybersecurity and the situation across the Taiwan Strait when cooking up the “Volt Typhoon”. China’s position is clear cut, that is we are strongly opposed to the US interference in China’s domestic affairs under the pretext of cybersecurity, and will stay on high alert against US true intentions behind their practice of fabricating a topic for discussion and then making use of it to serve their hidden agenda. Any attempt to gain advantage in future scenarios pertaining the Taiwan question shall be futile.

It is in the interest of all countries to protect critical infrastructure. And it is in the interest of all countries, including China and the US, to safeguard peace and stability in cyberspace. We hope that the US, as a major power, could take a more serious and responsible attitude. The US shall not overestimate its ability to unilaterally set the rules in cyberspace according to its own will, nor underestimate China’s resolve to maintain, on equal terms, bilateral relations pertaining cybersecurity.",China

China urged the U.S. side not to engage in bloc confrontation and undermine peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Chinese side made clear its position on Taiwan, trade, science and technology, people-to-people and cultural exchanges and other issues, urging the U.S. side to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop impeding China's development, stop imposing unreasonable sanctions on Chinese enterprises and stop suppressing China's trade, science and technology.",China
070424,Li Qiang Meets with U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen,"On the morning of April 7, 2024, Premier Li Qiang of the State Council met with U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Li Qiang said that under the strategic guidance of the two presidents, the current China-U.S. relationship is beginning to stabilize. Not long ago President Xi Jinping spoke with President Joe Biden on the phone, and both sides agreed to strengthen dialogue, manage differences and advance cooperation to promote the steady development of China-U.S. relations. The Chinese side hopes that China and the U.S. will be partners rather than adversaries, and will respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation. Li Qiang expressed the hope that the U.S. will further work with China in the same direction, continue to act on the common understandings between the two presidents, and turn the San Francisco vision into reality.

Li Qiang pointed out that as the world's two largest economies, China and the U.S. have deeply intertwined economic interests. Closer trade and economic cooperation is of great importance to each other's development and global economic growth. The two sides should strengthen communication to jointly find ways to manage and resolve differences, so as to make China-U.S. trade and economic cooperation stable, smooth and efficient, create more benefits for the enterprises and people of the two countries, and contribute to the world's economic development and improvement of people's livelihoods. Li Qiang expressed the hope that the U.S. will work with China to uphold the basic norms of market economy including fair competition and open cooperation, rather than politicize or impose security implications on economic and trade issues, and view issues of industrial capacity objectively and dialectically from a market-oriented and global perspective and in accordance with the economic laws. The development of China's new energy industry will contribute significantly to the green and low-carbon transition worldwide. China is ready to strengthen policy coordination with the U.S. on climate change and other issues to jointly address global challenges.

Janet Yellen said that with the joint efforts of both sides, the U.S.-China relationship has become more stable. As the world's two largest economies, the U.S. and China should manage bilateral economic relations responsibly. The U.S. side appreciates the progress made in U.S.-China economic dialogue and cooperation, does not seek ""decoupling"" from China, and stands ready to work with China to implement the important common understandings reached at the two presidents' meeting in San Francisco, communicate candidly, avoid misunderstandings, deepen exchanges and cooperation, properly manage differences, jointly cope with pressing global challenges, and promote the steady development of the U.S.-China relations.",China
020424,President Xi Jinping Speaks with U.S. President Joe Biden on the Phone,"On the evening of April 2, President Xi Jinping spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden on the phone at the request of the latter. The two presidents had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and issues of mutual interest.

President Xi Jinping noted that his San Francisco meeting with President Biden last November opened a future-oriented San Francisco vision. Over the past months, their officials have acted on the presidential understandings in earnest. The China-U.S. relationship is beginning to stabilize, and this is welcomed by both societies and the international community. On the other hand, the negative factors of the relationship have also been growing, and this requires attention from both sides.

President Xi Jinping stressed that the issue of strategic perception is always fundamental to the China-U.S. relationship, just like the first button of a shirt that must be put right. Two big countries like China and the United States should not cut off their ties or turn their back on each other, still less slide into conflict or confrontation. The two countries should respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation. The relationship should continue moving forward in a stable, sound and sustainable way, rather than going backward.

President Xi Jinping underlined three overarching principles that should guide China-U.S. relations in 2024. First, peace must be valued. The two sides should put a floor of no conflict and no confrontation under the relationship, and keep reinforcing the positive outlook of the relationship. Second, stability must be prioritized. The two sides should refrain from setting the relationship back, provoking incident or crossing the line, so as to maintain the overall stability of the relationship. Third, credibility must be upheld. The two sides should honor their commitments to each other with action, and turn the San Francisco vision into reality. They need to strengthen dialogue in a mutually respectful way, manage differences prudently, advance cooperation in the spirit of mutual benefit, and step up coordination on international affairs in a responsible way.

President Xi Jinping stressed that the Taiwan question is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations. In the face of “Taiwan independence” separatist activities and external encouragement and support for them, China is not going to sit on its hands. He urged the U.S. side to translate President Biden’s commitment of not supporting “Taiwan independence” into concrete actions. The U.S. side has adopted a string of measures to suppress China’s trade and technology development, and is adding more and more Chinese entities to its sanctions lists. This is not “de-risking,” but creating risks. If the U.S. side is willing to seek mutually beneficial cooperation and share in China’s development dividends, it will always find China’s door open; but if it is adamant on containing China’s hi-tech development and depriving China of its legitimate right to development, China is not going to sit back and watch.

President Xi Jinping stated China’s position on Hong Kong-related issues, human rights, the South China Sea, and other issues.

President Joe Biden noted that the U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world. The progress in the relationship since the San Francisco meeting demonstrates that the two sides can advance cooperation while responsibly managing differences. President Biden reiterated that the United States does not seek a new Cold War, its objective is not to change China’s system, its alliances are not targeted against China, the U.S. does not support “Taiwan independence,” and the U.S. does not seek conflict with China. The U.S. follows the one-China policy. It is in the interest of the world for China to succeed. The U.S. does not want to curtail China’s development, and does not seek “decoupling” from China. The U.S. will send Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to visit China shortly to strengthen dialogue and communication, avoid miscalculation and promote cooperation, so as to advance the relationship on a stable path and jointly respond to global challenges.

The two presidents also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and other issues.

The two presidents found the phone call to be candid and constructive. The two sides agreed to stay in communication, and tasked their teams to deliver on the San Francisco vision, including advancing the consultation mechanisms on diplomatic, economic, financial, commercial and other issues as well as mil-to-mil communication, carrying out dialogue and cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, artificial intelligence and climate response, taking further steps to expand people-to-people exchanges, and enhancing communication on international and regional issues. The Chinese side welcomed visits to China by Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the near future.",China
270324,"President Xi Jinping Meets Representatives of U.S. Business, Strategic and Academic Communities","On March 27, President Xi Jinping met with representatives of the U.S. business, strategic and academic communities at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.



President Xi Jinping welcomed members of the U.S. business, strategic and academic communities to China in blooming spring. He noted that the China-U.S. relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. Whether China and the United States have a cooperative or confrontational relationship bears on the well-being of the Chinese and American peoples and the future of humanity. The two countries’ respective success is an opportunity for each other. As long as both sides see each other as partners and show mutual respect, coexist in peace and cooperate for win-win results, China-U.S. relations will get better. This year marks the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. The history of China-U.S. relations is one of friendly exchanges between the two peoples. Its existing chapters are written by the people, and the future will of course be created by the people. As a Chinese saying goes, doing good is as hard as an uphill climb, while a misstep may easily lead to a free fall. President Xi Jinping expressed the hope that people from all sectors of Chinese and American societies will have more mutual visits and exchanges, expand common ground and mutual trust, overcome various distractions, and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, in an effort to bring more tangible benefits to the two peoples and inject more stability into the world. 



President Xi Jinping listened attentively to his U.S. guests and responded to their comments.



President Xi Jinping pointed out that the Chinese economy is sound and sustainable. Last year, China registered one of the highest growth rates among the major economies and accounted for over 30 percent of global growth as before. This was due both to the hard work of the Chinese people and to international cooperation. China has come to where it is today after overcoming all kinds of difficulties and challenges. China did not collapse as predicted by the “China collapse theory,” nor will it peak as forecasted by the “China peak theory.” We will continue to advance high-quality development and Chinese modernization, enable the Chinese people to live a better life, and contribute more to sustainable development in the world. We have the confidence and determination that China’s development has a bright future. 



President Xi Jinping recalled his oft-repeated saying that reform and opening up holds the key to contemporary China’s catching up with the times in great strides. China’s reform will not pause, and its opening up will not stop. China is planning and implementing a series of major steps for comprehensively deepening reform, and steadily fostering a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment. This will create broader development space for U.S. and other foreign businesses. Faced with the recent years’ new and evolving situation in China-U.S. business ties, the two sides should stay committed to mutual respect, mutual benefit and equal-footed consultation, follow economic and market rules, expand and deepen mutually beneficial business cooperation, respect each other’s development rights, and work for win-win outcomes for the two countries and the world at large. U.S. businesses are welcome to participate more in Belt and Road cooperation, attend large-scale business events such as the China International Import Expo, and continue to invest in China, cultivate the market and grow their business.

President Xi Jinping emphasized that over the past couple of years, the China-U.S. relationship experienced some setbacks and serious challenges, from which lessons should be learned. The relationship cannot go back to the old days, but it can embrace a brighter future. The most important understanding he reached with President Biden at last year’s San Francisco meeting was on the need to stabilize and improve China-U.S. relations. In the past few months, Chinese and U.S. officials have worked to follow through on the common understandings of the two Presidents, maintained communication and made progress in the political and diplomatic, economic and financial, law enforcement and counternarcotics, climate change and people-to-people fields. Under the new circumstances, China and the United States have more, not fewer, common interests. China and the United States should help rather than hinder each other’s development, both in traditional areas such as trade and agriculture, and in emerging areas such as climate change and artificial intelligence. Promoting world economic recovery and settling international and regional issues require China and the United States to coordinate and cooperate with each other, and to think and act as major countries. The U.S. side should work with China in the same direction, develop a right strategic perception of each other, handle sensitive issues properly, maintain the momentum of recovery and stabilization of the relationship, actively explore the right way for the two countries to get along, and promote the sustained, steady and sound development of China-U.S. relations.



In their remarks, Chair of the Board of Directors of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman and CEO of Blackstone Stephen A. Schwarzman, President and CEO of Qualcomm Cristiano R. Amon, Founding Dean of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government Graham Allison, and President of the U.S.-China Business Council Craig Allen thanked President Xi Jinping for taking time to meet them. They noted that China’s exceptional economic growth and transformation over the past decades speak to its strong resilience and vitality. Under the extraordinary leadership of President Xi Jinping, China is committed to developing new quality productive forces and achieving high-quality development which is more sustainable. The development rights of the Chinese people should be respected. They expressed confidence that China will realize its development goals and contribute to a stronger, more integrated global economy. A strong and prosperous China is a positive force in the world. Sharing close economic ties, the United States and China can only develop and thrive in peaceful coexistence. The Thucydides trap is not inevitable. U.S. businesses applaud the important measures that China has recently rolled out to further reform and open up, are optimistic about China’s development prospects, will maintain their strong commitment to the Chinese market, and pursue close and long-term cooperation with China. The San Francisco meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden last November has shored up the expectation and confidence of all sectors of American society and the world in U.S.-China relations. The U.S. business, strategic and academic communities support the United States and China in bolstering exchanges and communication at all levels, enhancing mutual understanding, trust and cooperation, joining hands to address global challenges, and fostering a stable, sustainable and productive U.S.-China relationship.

260324,Wang Yi Meets with Responsible Officials of National Committee on U.S.-China Relations,"On March 26, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Chairman of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR) Evan G. Greenberg and President of the NCUSCR Stephen A. Orlins in Beijing.

Wang Yi said, in November last year, the NCUSCR together with other friendly organizations, overcame difficulties and obstacles and, in response to the common aspirations of the two peoples, held a grand welcome banquet for President Xi Jinping in San Francisco. In his speech, President Xi Jinping reviewed the history of friendly exchanges between the two peoples and stressed that the hope and foundation of China-U.S. relations lies with the people, the future lies with the youth and the vitality lies with sub-national entities. Wang Yi expressed the hope that the NCUSCR will continue to play a constructive role in strengthening exchanges between the two peoples and promoting the sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations.



Wang Yi stressed that the crux of China-U.S. relations is that the United States has positioned China as its most important strategic competitor and most important geopolitical challenge. Such misunderstanding has led to constant problems in bilateral relations, and promises made by U.S. leaders have failed to translate into concrete actions. Such a situation runs counter to the interests of the two peoples, the expectations of the international community and the trend of historical development. The United States should work with China to provide more support and facilitation for exchanges between the two peoples, enhance mutual understanding through face-to-face contacts, and stabilize, improve and advance bilateral relations.

The U.S. side said President Xi Jinping's visit to San Francisco was highly successful, setting a new tone and direction for bilateral relations between the two countries. President Xi Jinping engaged in candid communication with various sectors of the United States and announced the invitation of 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study over the next five years, which was warmly welcomed. The relationship between the United States and China is the most significant bilateral relationship in the world. Maintaining communication and contact to ensure that the relationship between the two countries progresses in a constructive direction is beneficial for the entire world. U.S.-China relations begin with contact, which does not mean compromise, but is the only way for the sound and correct development of bilateral relations. The NCUSCR will continue to play a positive role in promoting exchanges and contacts between the two countries.",China
260324,Wang Yi Meets with Professor Graham Allison from Harvard University,"On March 26, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with Professor Graham Allison from Harvard University in Beijing.

Wang Yi said the most important event in international relations for the past 50 years is the recovery and development of China-U.S. relations. In the next 50 years, what the international community expects most is that China and the United States find a proper way to get along with each other. On the basis of a profound review of the development of China-U.S. relations, President Xi Jinping has put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, which are consistent with traditional Chinese culture and China's diplomatic philosophy, and provide fundamental guidance for China to view and handle China-U.S. relations.

Wang Yi said, China and the United States are countries with completely different histories and cultures, and cannot judge each other by their own standards. Chinese philosophy suggests harmony without uniformity, and holds that different roads may run in parallel without interfering with one another, and all living things may grow side by side without harming one another. This is essentially different from the binary opposition thinking of some Americans, which is characterized by a black-and-white and I-win-you-lose approach. The Chinese side believes that China and the United States should jointly address the global challenges and establish a more stable, sound and sustainable relationship. Bearing the future of humankind in mind, President Xi Jinping has also proposed the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind. This is not only a lofty goal pursued by Chinese diplomacy but also provides a Chinese solution to the questions of ""what kind of world to build and how to build it"". Wang Yi expressed the hope that the academia will strengthen research on the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other and the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and propose constructive ideas beyond the traditional theory of international relations.



Graham Allison said Chinese leaders have given deep thought to the world today and to U.S.-China relations. President Xi Jinping's proposal of the three principles for developing China-U.S. relations is highly significant and enlightening. China's explanation of mutual respect as the precondition, peaceful coexistence as the baseline, and win-win cooperation as the goal is helpful for the academia to better understand China's foreign policy. In today's complex world, binary opposition cannot solve the problems. China and the United States must cooperate and find a correct way to get along with each other, which is crucial to both countries and the world. Graham Allison expressed the willingness to gain a deep understanding of China's profound history and culture, and to better understand China's foreign policy, in particular the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind.",China

Schwarzman in Beijing.

Cai Qi said that China-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral relations in today's world. To implement the common understandings reached between the two heads of state and realize the San Francisco vision is the most important task for the two sides, which requires active participation and support of people from all walks of life in the two countries. China is now advancing the building of a strong nation and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. He expressed the hope that Mr. Schwarzman will continue to cultivate success in China, share opportunities together, promote educational cooperation and people-to-people and cultural exchanges between the two countries, increase the trust and friendship between the two peoples, especially those between the youth of the two countries, tell a good story of China-U.S. friendship and cooperation, consolidate the public support of bilateral relations, and inject more positive energy into China-U.S. relations.

Stephen A. Schwarzman said that, with the joint efforts of both sides, the Schwarzman program launched eleven years ago has made positive progress. He expressed the willingness to strengthen cooperation with China to increase exchanges and mutual learning between China and the world so that more people can understand China's development prospects, and contribute to the stable development of U.S.-China relations and the building of a better world.",China

020324,Han Zheng Attends and Addresses the AmCham China Annual Appreciation Dinner,"On March 1, 2024, at the invitation of the American Chamber of Commerce in the People's Republic of China (AmCham China), Vice President Han Zheng attended and addressed the AmCham China Annual Appreciation Dinner in Beijing.

Han Zheng said, as this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters. The ""San Francisco vision"" reached at the meeting between the two heads of state last year has charted the course for the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations and drawn a blueprint. Over the past half century, China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has achieved tangible results and made important contributions to the economic and social development of both countries. The business communities of the two countries are participants, witnesses and contributors to the bilateral cooperation, and will also be pioneers of more and better cooperation in the future. Han Zheng expressed the hope that the business circles of China and the United States will consolidate the foundation of friendship and mutual trust, actively expand cooperation areas, create a favorable environment for development, and promote China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation for mutual benefit as well as steady and sustained progress.

Han Zheng said that China's economy has strong resilience, great potential and vast space, and new drivers and advantages are still developing and growing. As China's development achievements have been made in the opening up, China will unswervingly expand opening up at a high level, continue to reduce the negative list for foreign investment access, effectively guarantee the national treatment for foreign-funded enterprises, and foster a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment to provide more opportunities for companies of all countries, including American companies, for their development in China. Noting that the China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation has huge potential, broad space and promising prospects, Han Zheng welcomed more friends from the U.S. business community to invest and do business in China. He expressed the expectation that AmCham China can keep in mind its original intention and forge ahead, strengthen communication and contacts with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and other organizations, and jointly push for more results in China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation.

280224,Li Qiang Meets with U.S. Chamber of Commerce Delegation,"On the morning of February 28, 2024, Premier Li Qiang of the State Council met with a U.S. Chamber of Commerce delegation led by President and Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Suzanne P. Clark at the Great Hall of the People.

Li Qiang said that since the summit meeting between the heads of state of China and the United States in San Francisco last November, the two sides have carried out a series of dialogues and communication to promote pragmatic cooperation between the two countries. This year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters, emphasizing the continuous commitment to stabilizing and developing China-U.S. relations for the benefit of both countries and the world. The practice over the past 45 years has proved repeatedly that China and the United States both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, and cooperation is the only correct choice. Based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, China is ready to work with the United States to follow through on the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state to promote the sound and steady development of bilateral relations.

Li Qiang noted that the Chinese and U.S. economies are highly complementary, and their interests are deeply integrated. Both sides benefit from each other's development, and strengthening economic and trade cooperation is beneficial to both countries. The two sides should be partners rather than rivals. Engaging in ""decoupling and severing supply chains"" or ""a small yard, high fences"" in all forms is not in the fundamental interests of both sides and will only bring huge losses to enterprises in the two countries, to the economy, and even to global development. China is now advancing Chinese modernization on all fronts through high-quality development, and will continue to unleash huge demand in advanced manufacturing, new urbanization, the upgrading of the consumption structure, green and low-carbon transformations, and other aspects. U.S. companies are welcome to continue investing in China and exploring the Chinese market to share the development opportunities. China will open its door even wider to the outside world, continue to foster a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized, and provide more support and convenience for U.S. companies and firms from other countries to invest and do business in China. He expressed the hope that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its entrepreneurs will continue to serve as a bridge in promoting more communication and mutual understanding between the two countries.

Clark said that the U.S.-China relationship is extremely important. She was pleased that the two heads of state held a successful summit meeting in San Francisco, and that the relationship between the two countries showed momentum of improvement. Decoupling between the United States and China is not a viable option, and China's further opening-up is welcome. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is willing to act as a bridge, conduct candid and constructive communication and exchanges with the Chinese side, make efforts to deepen U.S.-China economic and trade relations and mutually beneficial cooperation, and promote the steady development of U.S.-China relations.

He extended holiday wishes to them and all the teachers and students of the school, and encouraged more young Americans to come to China for exchange and study.

Noting the students' beautiful handwriting of Chinese characters and their vivid hand drawings of the Chinese dragon, Great Wall and panda in the letter, Xi Jinping said he was very pleased to know that the students visited several cities in China, where they saw the giant pandas, tasted Chinese food, experienced Chinese culture, and felt “super happy”. Learning that they have made friends with many Chinese peers and invited them to pay a return visit to their hometown, Xi said he found their friendship very heart touching.

Quoting a Chinese proverb, Xi Jinping said ""seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times"". He recalled his first visit to the United States in 1985, and noted that he was deeply impressed by the warmth and friendliness of the American people during the trip. Xi expressed the belief that through this visit, the students would have a more direct and deeper understanding of China and the Chinese people. He said the students are welcome to visit China again, and encouraged more young Americans to visit China for exchange and study, so as to have a glimpse of the real China in a multi-dimensional and comprehensive manner, and make heart-to-heart friendship with young Chinese and learn from each other, thus making joint contributions to enhancing the friendship between the people of the two countries.

Xi Jinping said in his letter that today is the Lantern Festival of the Chinese Year of the Dragon and it is an important occasion for the Chinese people to wish for a better life. Xi extended his best holiday wishes to the students and all the teachers and students of their school.

Blinken at the latter's request on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. The two sides had a candid, substantive and constructive meeting.

Wang Yi said, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a successful meeting at the end of last year, where they had an in-depth exchange of views on strategic and overarching issues critical to the direction of China-U.S. relations and reached important common understandings. The most important task for the two sides now is to follow the strategic guidance of the two heads of state, make the ""San Francisco vision"" a reality, and move forward China-U.S. relations along the track of sound, steady and sustainable development. To this end, the two sides should adhere to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and actively explore the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other. The U.S. side should take an objective and rational view of China's development, pursue a positive and pragmatic China policy, and honor President Biden's commitments with concrete actions.

Wang Yi stressed that there is but one China in the world, and Taiwan is part of China's territory. This is the true status quo of the Taiwan question. It is the ""Taiwan independence"" separatist activities and the connivance and support of external forces that are trying to change this status quo. If the U.S. side genuinely hopes to see stability across the Taiwan Strait, it should abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, and follow through on its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"".

Wang Yi emphasized that the attempts to ""de-China"" in the name of ""de-risking"" and to build ""a small yard with high fences"" to ""decouple from China"" will ultimately backfire on the U.S. itself. Wang Yi called on the U.S. side to lift its illegal unilateral sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals and refrain from doing things harmful to China's legitimate development rights and interests.



The two sides had an exchange of views on carrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges and facilitating personnel exchanges. Wang Yi urged the U.S. side to stop the unwarranted harassment and interrogation of Chinese citizens and do more things conducive to enhancing mutual understanding between the two peoples. As an old Chinese saying goes, ""An act of kindness, no matter how trivial, is worth doing, while an act of evil, no matter how small, must be shunned.""

The two sides discussed exchanges at all levels between the two countries in the next stage, and agreed to maintain dialogue and communication in various fields and further deliver on the ""San Francisco vision"". Both sides spoke highly of the work of the China-U.S. counter-narcotics cooperation working group, and expressed the expectation that the coming high-level meeting between the law enforcement departments of the two countries will achieve positive results. Both sides agreed to continue to promote dialogue and consultation on foreign policy, Asia-Pacific affairs, maritime affairs and artificial intelligence, and maintain military-to-military communication.

The two sides also had an exchange of views on the Ukraine crisis, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Korean Peninsula and other regional hotspot issues, and agreed to keep contact between the two sides' special envoys for Peninsula affairs.",China

The two sides had candid, substantive and productive strategic communication on implementing the common understandings reached between the two heads of state at the summit meeting in San Francisco and properly handling important and sensitive issues in China-U.S. relations.

Wang Yi said that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. The two sides should take this opportunity to sum up experience and draw lessons, treat each other as equals instead of in a condescending way, build common ground and shelving instead of highlighting differences, and respect instead of undermining each other's core interests. Both sides should work together toward mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, finding the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other.

Wang Yi stressed that the Taiwan question is China's internal affair, and the election in the Taiwan region cannot change the basic fact that Taiwan is part of China. ""Taiwan independence"" poses the biggest risk to cross-Strait peace and stability and the biggest challenge to China-U.S. relations. The U.S. side must abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, translate its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"" into action and support China's peaceful reunification.

Wang Yi pointed out that every country has its national security concerns, but these concerns must be legitimate and reasonable. There should be no politicizing or overstretching of the concept of security, nor can these concerns be used to suppress and contain other countries' development. The two sides agreed to further discuss the boundary between national security and economic activities.

The two sides agreed to jointly implement the ""San Francisco vision"": the two heads of state will maintain regular contact to provide strategic guidance to bilateral relations; promote exchanges in various fields and at various levels between China and the United States, make good use of current strategic communication channels as well as a series of dialogue and consultation mechanisms in such areas as diplomacy, military, economy, finance, business and climate change; continue discussions on the guiding principles of China-U.S. relations; launch a working group on counternarcotics cooperation between China and the United States in the near future; hold the first meeting of China-U.S. inter-governmental dialogue mechanism on artificial intelligence this spring; and take further steps to expand cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.

100124,Xi Jinping Replies to Letter from His Friend Sarah Lande in the U.S. State of Iowa,"On January 4, 2024, President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from his friend Sarah Lande in the U.S. State of Iowa.

Xi Jinping pointed out that since the establishment of China-U.S. diplomatic relations 45 years ago, bilateral relations have gone through the tests of winds and rains, and grown into a towering tree, bearing the fruits of cooperation and delivering benefits to both countries and the rest of the world. Achievements in China-U.S. relations are first attributable to the collective efforts of the two peoples. For China-U.S. relations to advance, it hinges more on the two peoples.

Xi Jinping emphasized that the future of China-U.S. relations depends on the youth. Citing the Chinese saying ""Read 10,000 books and travel 10,000 miles,"" Xi Jinping expressed his hope that more young Americans will visit China, observe China with their own eyes, listen to China with their own ears and measure China with their own footsteps to have a glimpse of a real China in a multi-dimensional and comprehensive manner and build more bridges of the close affinity between the two peoples when he announced that China will invite 50,000 young Americans to China for exchange and study in the next five years. Xi Jinping said, he welcomes the students of Muscatine to participate in this project.

Xi Jinping emphasized that China is the largest developing country and the United States is the largest developed country in the world, the future of this planet needs stability and improvement of China-U.S. relations. China is ready to work with the United States to push for steady, sound and sustainable development of bilateral relations to bring more benefits to the two peoples, provide more public goods for the international community, and build a clean and beautiful world, featuring lasting peace, security for all, common prosperity, openness, and inclusiveness.

In a recent letter to President Xi Jinping, Sarah Lande, a friend in the U.S. State of Iowa, said, President Xi Jinping's speech at a welcome dinner held by the friendly organizations in the United States was widely welcomed and inspiring.

050124,Wang Yi Puts Forward Three Proposals on Implementing the Important Common Understandings Reached Between the Two Heads of State of China and the United States,"On January 5, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi put forward three proposals on implementing the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state when attending the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.

First, uphold mutual respect, with having a right perception of each other as the current priority. Are China and the United States partners or adversaries? This is an overarching question determining where this relationship will be heading. The Chinese people believe that “all ways of life should thrive without hindering each other; all living things should flourish without harming each other.” China’s development and rejuvenation is driven by its robust internal dynamics and is a historical inevitability. To advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization means that China will take on more responsibility and make greater contribution to world peace and development. We have no intention to displace or lord over anyone, still less to seek hegemony. What we are committed to is building a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship on the basis of mutual respect. We hope that the U.S. side will go easy on itself, and in the spirit of equality and inclusiveness, respect the choice of the Chinese people, respect the development path of China, respect China’s core interests, and respect China’s efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Second, ensure peaceful coexistence, with with effective management of disagreements as the top priority. China and the United States differ in social system and development path due to their different histories and cultural traditions. Disagreements should not lead to confrontation, still less willful sanctions, power politics, hegemonism or zero-sum game. What is needed is a vision and unwavering commitment to seeking common ground while shelving differences, and allowing no disagreements or differences to dominate or disrupt the bilateral relationship. 45 years ago, China and the United States were able to rise above disagreements and establish diplomatic relations. Today, we must assume such vision and sense of responsibility. President Xi Jinping once pointed out that disagreements should not be a chasm to keep the two countries apart, and that instead, the two sides should look for ways to build bridges to help them walk toward each other. That is the right approach for China and the United States to handle disagreements.

Third, pursue win-win cooperation, with mutually beneficial collaboration as the ballast. Over the past few years, thanks to the joint efforts from both sides, military-to-military communications and dialogue have recently resumed on the basis of equality and respect, and the working group on counternarcotics cooperation will soon be launched after the removal of the obstacle of unilateral sanctions. Going forward, the two sides must continue to make the most of the mechanisms resumed or established in diplomatic, economic, financial, commercial and agricultural areas. They should build bridges of communication as soon as possible, and pave the way for cooperation. They should remove barriers to exchanges, break false information cocoons, forge closer links between the two peoples, and generate more positive energy for the sound growth of China-U.S. relations.",China
050124,Wang Yi Talks about Inspirations Drawn from the Growth of China-U.S. Relations,"On January 5, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of China-U.S. diplomatic relations in Beijing. Wang Yi elaborated on three inspirations drawn from the 45-year growth of China-U.S. relations.

First, peace is the most fundamental bedrock of the China-U.S. relations. As the largest developing country and the largest developed country of the world, China and the United States together account for one-fourth of the global population and more than one-third of the world’s economic aggregate. No conflict or confrontation between the two major countries is in itself the most important peace dividend for mankind. The absence of conflict and confrontation between the two major countries is in itself the most important peace dividend for humanity. Meanwhile, as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the two countries shoulder primary responsibility for world peace and security.

Second, cooperation is THE right choice for China and the United States to get along with each other. Over the past few decades, the whole world has witnessed for decade show powerful China-U.S. cooperation has been -- in counter-terrorism,addressing global financial crises, fighting Ebola, and seeking political solutions to hotspot issues. Under the current circumstances, their common interests are growing not declining, and the necessity for cooperation increasing not decreasing. It can be said that for the two countries and the world, China-U.S. cooperation is not something dispensable or optional.It is a compulsory question that must be addressed in real earnest.

Third, win-win cooperation is the most essential feature of China-U.S. interaction. The nearly U.S.$760 billion bilateral trade and over U.S.$260 billion two-way investment between China and the United States tells a lot about their complementarity in economic structure, connectivity in global industrial and supply chains, and shared interest in common development.. It is an inevitable outcome of international division of labor in the globalized world, a rational decision by the two business communities, and a natural option out of complementarity. Mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States is like a mighty river flowing into the ocean. Any decoupling attempt to stem the tide will only be counterproductive and self-defeating.",China
050124,Wang Yi Attends the Commemoration of the 45th Anniversary of China-U.S. Diplomatic Relations,"On January 5, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the commemoration of the 45th anniversary of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.

Wang Yi said in his address that January 1 this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America. President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden have exchanged congratulatory letters. President Xi Jinping pointed out in his letter that over the past 45 years, China-U.S. relations have kept moving forward on the whole in spite of ups and downs, and that this has not only improved the well-being of the two peoples, but also contributed to peace, stability and prosperity of the world. Both presidents highlighted their continued commitment to stabilizing and developing China-U.S. relations to the benefit of the two countries and the world as a whole.

Wang Yi pointed out that 45 years ago, with outstanding strategic vision and extraordinary political courage, the elder generation of Chinese and the U.S. leaders, established the one-China principle, thus opening long-shut doors and starting all-round exchanges between the two long-estranged major countries. Through the past 45 years, China-U.S. relations have overcome various difficulties and disruptions, and kept advancing, with the breadth of their cooperation, the depth of their entwined interests, and the magnitude of impact and influence of their relationship reaching unprecedented levels. Plants with strong roots grow well, and efforts in the right way ensure success. Making its way through twists and turns for nearly half a century, the China-U.S. relationship is like a surging river -- much is washed away but the most valuable stays, namely, useful inspirations regarding the fundamentals of their relationship.



First, peace is the most fundamental bedrock of China-U.S. relations. The absence of conflict and confrontation between the two major countries is in itself the most important peace dividend for humanity. Second, cooperation is the right choice for China and the United States to get along with each other. Under the current circumstances, the necessity of cooperation between China and the United States is increasing not decreasing. For the two countries and the world, China-U.S. cooperation is not something dispensable or optional. It is a compulsory question that must be addressed in real earnest. Third, win-win cooperation is the most essential feature of China-U.S. interaction. The nearly 760 billion U.S. dollars of bilateral trade and over 260 billion U.S. dollars of two-way investment between China and the United States tell a lot about their complementarity in economic structure, connectivity in global industrial and supply chains, and the shared interest in common development. Any decoupling attempt to stem the tide will only be counterproductive and self-defeating.

Wang Yi emphasized that today, transformation not seen in a century is unfolding across the world. China-U.S. relationship is the most important and intricate bilateral relationship in the world. How to re-calibrate the direction of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations, steer it clear of hidden rocks and shoals, and guide it through gorges of historical significance is a major subject that we must think about thoroughly and a question we must answer for our times. Last November, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a historic meeting in San Francisco, and created the future-oriented San Francisco vision, charting the course for and adding impetus to the bilateral relationship. The two sides should take San Francisco as a new starting point, make the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation the right way to get along with each other, and truly deliver on the important common understandings reached by the two presidents.

The two sides should uphold mutual respect, with having a right perception of each other as the current priority. Are China and the United States partners or adversaries? This is an overarching question determining where this relationship will be heading. To advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization means that China will take on more responsibility and make greater contribution to world peace and development. China has no intention to displace or lord over anyone, still less to seek hegemony. What China is committed to is building a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship on the basis of mutual respect. We hope that the U.S. side will go easy on itself, and in the spirit of equality and inclusiveness, respect the choice of the Chinese people, respect the development path of China, respect China’s core interests, and respect China’s efforts to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.



The two sides should ensure peaceful coexistence, with effective management of disagreements as the top priority.

They should remove barriers to exchanges, break false information cocoons, forge closer links between the two peoples, and generate more positive energy for the sound growth of China-U.S. relations. Wang Yi hopes that in the new year both Chinese and Americans with vision and insight from all sectors will come forward with their energy and dynamism and work together to push forward the China-U.S. relationship in the right direction.

Chargé d'Affaires at the U.S. Embassy in China David Meale also addressed the reception. He extended on behalf of the U.S. side congratulations on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and China, saying that the U.S. side is willing to implement the common understandings reached between the two heads of state and promote the steady development of U.S.-China relations.

The reception was co-hosted by the Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and attended by more than 350 friends from all walks of life of the two countries.",China
010124,Leaders of China and the United States Exchange Congratulatory Letters on the 45th Anniversary of the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the Two Countries,"On January 1, 2024, President Xi Jinping and President of the United States Joe Biden exchanged congratulatory letters on the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

In his letter, Xi Jinping pointed out that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States is a major event in the history of bilateral and international relations. Over the past 45 years, despite the ups and downs, the China-U.S. relationship has on the whole moved forward, which has not only enhanced the well-being of the two peoples, but also promoted world peace, stability and prosperity. History has fully proven and will continue to prove that upholding mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation is the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other as two major countries, and should become the common direction of efforts of both China and the United States in the new era.

Xi Jinping noted that he and President Biden, during their summit meeting in San Francisco, laid out a future-oriented ""San Francisco vision"", charting the course for the development of China-U.S. relations. The two sides should earnestly implement the important common understandings and outcomes reached between the two heads of state, and take concrete actions to promote the stable, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations.

Xi Jinping emphasized that he is willing to work with President Joe Biden to continue to steer the course of China-U.S. relations, to benefit the two countries and two peoples, and promote the cause of world peace and development.

In his letter, Joe Biden said that since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979, the interactions between the United States and China have promoted the prosperity and opportunity in the United States, China, and the world. He said he is committed to managing this important relationship responsibly and looks forward to continuing to advance the U.S.-China relationship based on the progress made by their predecessors as well as the progress they have made at their meetings and discussions on multiple occasions.",China

200323,"2022 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: China (Includes Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet)","",USA
270223,Country Reports on Terrorism 2021: China (Hong Kong and Macau),"Overview: The counterterrorism efforts of the People’s Republic of China continued to target  almost exclusively ethnic Uyghur and other Turkic Muslim alleged extremists, whom Beijing  labels as the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group Beijing considers the primary  source of terrorism in Xinjiang. However, the United States has not seen clear and convincing evidence of ETIM’s existence. In July and August, as the United States was withdrawing forces  from Afghanistan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on the Taliban to “re-impose the  ban on Xinjiang’s Uyghur militant group, ETIM,” and to “resolutely and effectively combat” the organization. Further, People’s Republic of China officials stated that Beijing would strengthen  ties with the Taliban to ensure “ETIM do[es] not function from Afghanistan’s soil targeting  Xinjiang.”

The Government of the People’s Republic of China’s measures, which it describes as  counterterrorism, have included holding more than one million people in detainment camps.  NGO data have identified more than 12,000 of these detainees who were sentenced to prison  terms, in most cases for five to 20 or more years. When questioned, the People’s Republic of  China claimed that the camps are vocational education and training centers. The People’s  Republic of China denies that its Xinjiang policies involve human rights abuses, claiming its  system of “reeducation” camps exist to “combat separatism and Islamist militancy in the region”  and are a crucial part of the “war on terror.” China continued to expand law enforcement tools  and enhance its military and counterterrorism capacities to justify and improve its ability to carry  out this repressive campaign, respond to threats because of China’s increasing global economic  footprint, and garner international support for its counterterrorism-related policies.

2021 Terrorist Incidents: People’s Republic of Chinese officials claimed that no violent  terrorist incidents occurred in the country; however, Chinese authorities continued to use  counterterrorism as a pretext to prosecute ethnic Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and  members of other ethnic and religious minorities, on terrorism charges. In April, Shirzat  Bawudun, former head of Xinjiang’s Department of Justice, and Sattar Sawut, former head of  Xinjiang’s Department of Education, were sentenced to death on terrorism and extremism  charges; five others were given lesser sentences.

International terrorist-related incidents associated with Chinese citizens continued in 2021,  including a targeted gun assault by a Sindhi separatist group in Karachi, Pakistan, that  wounded a People’s Republic of China national; a Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) attack on  China’s ambassador to Pakistan, during which four others died; a Balochistan Liberation Front  (BLA) attack on two People’s Republic of China nationals in Karachi; a BLA suicide bombing  attempt against Chinese interests in Gwadar, Pakistan; and the deaths of nine Chinese workers by  suicide bomb in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which China attributed to ETIM with  TTP’s assistance.

Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: The People’s Republic of China  continued to advance and defend its counterterrorism policies, including reeducation camps in  Xinjiang. On June 1, the People’s Bank of China issued a revised draft anti-money laundering  law for public comment, with the stated goal of preventing and curbing money laundering and  terrorist financing as well as safeguarding national security. As of this report’s publication, the  legislation has not been passed. Under the pretext of securing the border against ETIM  members, the People’s Republic of China placed politically motivated INTERPOL red notices  against Uyghurs.

Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  China is a member of the Financial Action Task  Force, the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, and the Eurasian Group on Combating  Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.  China’s Financial Intelligence Unit is not a member of the Egmont Group and lacks capacity or political will to effectively share financial  intelligence.

Based on current law enforcement investigations, the People’s Republic of China does not  adequately control terrorist financing. Chinese law enforcement claimed to have limited ability  to freeze funds and investigate banking transactions, and no corporate transparency regulations  exist. China piloted a central bank-backed digital currency known as the eCNY, or eCNY  Digital Currency Electronic Payment, to deter use of other virtual currencies, among other  objectives. The People’s Republic of China also increased regulatory scrutiny of the financial  sector by making improvements to the anti-money laundering framework. However, serious  shortcomings persisted in effective implementation and ensuring transparency, particularly in the  context of international cooperation.

Countering Violent Extremism: The People’s Republic of China continued to implement  broad repressive campaigns in Xinjiang under the guise of countering what the Chinese  government calls “extremism.” China’s repressive measures include mass “reeducation” and  “vocational training” of predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and  religious minority groups. Despite the United States’ 2021 determination that People’s Republic  of China authorities in Xinjiang have committed genocide and crimes against humanity and  strong condemnations from many other countries, China continued to defend its policies in  Xinjiang and obstructed access to the region by international observers. In October, Xinjiang  Uyghur Autonomous Region Spokesperson Xu Guixiang stated: “The so-called Xinjiang-related  issues are not ethnic, religious, or human rights issues at all, but antiviolence, antiterrorism, anti infiltration, antiseparation, and anti-interference issues.” Under the pretext of counterterrorism  efforts, the People’s Republic of China used existing domestic laws to actively screen, monitor,  and censor its citizens on the internet.

The People’s Armed Police is increasingly focused on internal security and joint operations with  the People’s Liberation Army and is developing capabilities for rapid response, mobility, and  counterterrorism operations, which included “counterterrorism in Xinjiang and Tibet.” In  December, the People’s Liberation Army conducted emergency drills and joint law enforcement  drills in a nationwide campaign. A 2021 Department of Defense report noted that the People’s  Republic of China continued to develop military and law enforcement capabilities and further  coordination between Chinese military and counterterrorism apparatuses, stating: “Xi Jinping  and the [Chinese Communist Party] leadership tasked the [People’s Armed Police] with  integrating themselves into the [People’s Liberation Army’s] joint operation system.”

International and Regional Cooperation: The People’s Republic of China engaged in  multilateral, regional, and bilateral fora, seeking to present itself as a global leader on  counterterrorism. China continued to promote the UN as the primary international forum for  counterterrorism, where it actively advances a repressive approach to counterterrorism.

On July 28, Wang Yi met with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, then the political chief of  Afghanistan’s Taliban, urging the Taliban to “make a clean break with all terrorist organizations,  including ETIM.” In response, the Taliban leader said it “will never allow any force to use  Afghan territory to engage in acts detrimental to China.”

In August the People’s Republic of China conducted antiterrorism drills with Tajikistan, citing  concerns about terrorist elements from Afghanistan spilling over the border. In September,  troops from China and Pakistan conducted a joint exercise as part of the Shanghai Cooperation  Organization’s (SCO’s) Regional Antiterrorism Structure. In September, President Xi presented  a five-point proposal underscoring SCO’s important efforts over the past 20 years. On  December 22, the China Institute of International Studies, which is affiliated with the MFA,  organized the second International Seminar on Counterterrorism, focused on new threats and  joint response measures to counter terrorism, particularly in Afghanistan, in which 17 countries  participated.

The People’s Republic of China is a member of the following organizations:

The ASEAN Regional Forum
The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
The East Asia Summit
The Global Counter Terrorism Forum
The SCO Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure
Hong Kong

Overview: Historically, Hong Kong has been neither a hub nor a target for international terrorist  groups or extremists and has long maintained highly efficient security forces. Strict travel  restrictions put in place by the Government of Hong Kong, because of the COVID-19  pandemic, have further reduced the likelihood of foreign terrorist threats to the city.  Consequently, Hong Kong law enforcement has not been a close partner on counterterrorism  matters, including intelligence sharing.

However, Hong Kong remains an important financial center and is geographically close to  countries with known domestic and foreign terrorism issues — including Indonesia and the  Philippines — providing a potential nexus for terrorist financing flows and a possible location  for terrorist activities when international travel returns to normal.

Hong Kong continued security and law enforcement cooperation with the United States through  the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department’s joint implementation of the Container Security Initiative. Hong Kong cooperated internationally on counterterrorism efforts through  INTERPOL and other security-focused organizations. Despite these efforts, the Government of  Hong Kong and its law enforcement apparatus could be a stronger partner on counterterrorism  and other security challenges, such as providing more information related to terrorism  financing and associated activities.

2021 Terrorist Incidents: The Hong Kong Police reported an incident on July 1, which it  described as a lone-wolf-style domestic terrorist attack, involving a man using a knife to wound a  male police officer and then killing himself.

Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Counterterrorism remained an  operational priority for the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF). The Police Counterterrorism  Response Unit provides a strong deterrent presence, assisting police districts with  counterterrorism strategy implementation and complementing the tactical and professional  support of existing police specialist units, such as the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau, the  Special Duties Unit, the Airport Security Unit, and the VIP Protection Unit.

In 2018 the Government of Hong Kong set up the Interdepartmental Counter-Terrorism Unit  (ICTU) to strengthen overall counterterrorism efforts by monitoring global trends, reviewing and  improving counterterrorism strategies in Hong Kong, developing specialized counterterrorism  training, and optimizing emergency response plans. The ICTU held its most recent  counterterrorism exercise in November.

Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Hong Kong is a member of the Financial Action  Task Force and the Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG). Hong Kong’s Joint  Financial Intelligence Unit is a member of the Egmont Group.

In May the Government of Hong Kong concluded a three-month consultation on legislative  proposals to enhance Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism  (AML/CTF) regime through the introduction of a licensing requirement for virtual asset services  providers and a registration system for dealers in precious metals and stones. As of December,  the government had not yet introduced a bill into the Legislative Council.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supervises financial institutions’ risk  management systems and takes disciplinary actions for those failing to comply with AML/CFT  measures. In 2021, disciplinary actions were taken against three Chinese banks and a Hong  Kong-based online payment provider. To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AML/CFT  measures, HKMA in November launched AML Regtech Lab, or AMLab, to allow  experimentation with technologies and data analytics for preventing and detecting financial  crimes.

In September the Securities and Futures Commission published its revised AML/CFT  guidelines, which include additional guidance to facilitate the adoption of a risk-based approach  to AML/CFT measures by securities industry participants. The revised guidelines require  financial institutions to apply additional due diligence and risk mitigation measures for cross border correspondent relationships in the securities sector, such as determining through publicly  available information whether the respondent institution has been subject to targeted financial  sanctions or regulatory actions and obtaining senior management’s approval before establishing  cross-border correspondent relationships. The guidelines also prohibit financial institutions from  establishing or continuing a cross-border correspondent relationship with a shell financial  institution.

Countering Violent Extremism:  There were no changes to Hong Kong’s CVE programming in  2021.

International and Regional Cooperation: In 2020, the President’s executive order on Hong  Kong normalization directed agencies to take action to end the provision of training to members  of the Hong Kong Police Force or other Hong Kong security services at the Department of  State’s International Law Enforcement Academies.

A Greater Bay Area (GBA) Anti-Money Laundering Summit was organized in October to  enhance exchange and cooperation on AML among mainland China, Hong Kong, and  Macau. The GBA refers to mainland China’s development plan to promote economic and social  integration between and among Hong Kong, Macau, and nine cities in Guangdong  province. Hong Kong is also an APEC economy.

During July 27-31, the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau conducted the first  Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau tripartite counter-cyber-and-physical-terrorism exercise with the Cyber Criminal Investigation Department of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security  Department and the Macau Judiciary Police. The exercise simulated a terrorist group planning to  launch a terrorist attack in Hong Kong.

Macau

Overview: Historically, Macau has not been a proactive partner on counterterrorism matters,  including intelligence sharing. Macau is neither a hub nor a target for international terrorist  groups or extremists and maintains highly efficient security services. The stringent travel  restrictions put in place by the Macau government because of the COVID-19 pandemic further  reduced the likelihood of foreign terrorist threats to the city. Macau is one of the most successful  and popular destinations for gambling globally and is geographically close to countries with  known domestic and foreign terrorism issues, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. When  international travel returns to normal levels, the city will potentially be a nexus for facilitating  terrorism financing or location for terrorist activities. The Police Intervention Tactical Unit  (UTIP) branch of the Macau Public Security Police Force is responsible for CT issues. UTIP’s  responsibilities include protecting important installations and dignitaries and IED deactivation.  Macau cooperated internationally on counterterrorism efforts through INTERPOL and other  security-focused organizations. Despite these efforts, Macau and its law enforcement apparatus  could be a stronger partner on counterterrorism and other security challenges, including  providing more information related to terrorism financing and associated activities.

2021 Terrorist Incidents:  No terrorist incidents were reported in Macau in 2021. Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There are no updates for 2021.

Countering the Financing of Terrorism: Macau is a member of the APG. Macau’s Financial  Intelligence Unit, the Financial Intelligence Office (GIF), is a member of the Egmont  Group. The GIF’s functions include freezing assets, introducing the AML/CFT assessment  standards of international organizations, and sharing international organizations’  recommendations for law enforcement authorities to step up AML/CFT efforts.

The GIF’s director was appointed by FATF in 2020 as co-chair of the Asia/Pacific Joint Group  (APJG), a financial action task force subgroup responsible for establishing sanction and  monitoring lists. The GIF director chaired or participated in more than 20 virtual APJG meetings  in 2021. The GIF provided AML/CFT training sessions to more than 900 practitioners from the  financial and gaming sectors in 2021.

Macau’s interdepartmental AML/CFT working group, which was established in 2002 and  currently consists of 15 government agencies, held one AML/CFT plenary meeting in May to  prioritize project items listed in the Five-Year Strategic Plan for Anti-Money Laundering (2021- 2025). The working group is responsible for tracking the development of AML/CFT  international standards and best practices, and formulating overall policies against money  laundering, terrorism financing, and the financing of proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction.

Countering Violent Extremism: There were no changes in 2021.

International and Regional Cooperation: In April the GIF signed an MOU with the New  Zealand Financial Intelligence Unit on the exchange of AML/CFT intelligence.

In July, Macau’s Judiciary Police conducted the first Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau tripartite  counter-cyber-and-physical-terrorism drill with the Guangdong Provincial Public Security  Department and the HKPF to prepare for a large-scale bomb attack and a hostage-taking crisis.

The 2020-21 tripartite online meeting among Macau authorities and those on the mainland and in  Hong Kong to foster cooperation on AML/CFT took place in October, in a virtual format, with a  focus on facilitating a cross-border intelligence-sharing mechanism.",USA
301122,"Countries of Particular Concern, Special Watch List Countries, Entities of Particular Concern","Under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) of 1998, the President is required to annually review the status of religious freedom in every country in the world and designate each country the government of which has engaged in or tolerated “particularly severe violations of religious freedom” as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC). The law defines particularly severe violations as “systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom,” including violations such as: (1) torture; (2) prolonged detention without charges; (3) forced disappearance; or (4) other flagrant denial of life, liberty, or security of persons.

Under the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2016 (Wolf Act), the President is required to “designate each country that engaged in or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom during the previous year, but does not meet” all the criteria for being designated as a CPC to a “Special Watch List” (SWL).

The Wolf Act also further requires the designation of Entities of Particular Concern (EPC) for non-state actors that have engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom. According to the law, a “non-state actor” is defined as “a nonsovereign entity that (A) exercises significant political power and territorial control; (B) is outside the control of a sovereign government; and (C) often employs violence in pursuit of its objectives.” The President has delegated the authority to make CPC, SWL, and EPC designations to the Secretary of State.

During the review period, the government made its enacted budget and end-of-year report accessible to the public, including online, but it did not publish an executive budget proposal before enacting the budget.  Information on debt obligations was publicly available but was not always complete or updated.  Budget documents did not identify financial allocations to or earnings from state-owned enterprises.  Not all major state-owned enterprises had publicly available audited financial statements and they did not disclose their debt holdings.  The supreme audit institution did not meet international standards of independence but reviewed the government’s accounts and made audit reports publicly available within a reasonable period.  The government specified in law or regulation and appeared to follow in practice the criteria and procedures for awarding natural resource extraction contracts and licenses.  Basic information on natural resource extraction awards was publicly available.

280722,2022 Investment Climate Statements: China,"In 2021, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was the number two global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) destination, behind the United States. As the world’s second-largest economy, with a large consumer base and integrated supply chains, China’s economic recovery following COVID-19 reassured investors and contributed to high FDI and portfolio investments. The PRC implemented major legislation in 2021, including the Data Security Law in September and the Personal Information Protection Law in November.

China remains a relatively restrictive investment environment for foreign investors due to restrictions in key sectors and regulatory uncertainties. Obstacles include ownership caps and requirements to form joint venture (JV) partnerships with local firms, industrial policies to develop indigenous capacity or technological self-sufficiency, and pressures to transfer technology as a prerequisite to gaining market access. New data and financial rules announced in 2021 also created significant uncertainty surrounding the financial regulatory environment. The PRC’s pandemic-related visa and travel restrictions significantly affected foreign businesses operations, increasing labor and input costs. An assertive Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and emphasis on national companies and self-reliance has heightened foreign investors’ concerns about the pace of economic reforms.

Key developments in 2021 included:

The Rules for Security Reviews on Foreign Investments came into effect January 18, expanding PRC vetting of foreign investment that may affect national security.
The National People’s Congress (NPC) adopted the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law on June 10.
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) issued draft revisions to its Cybersecurity Review Measures to broaden PRC approval authority over PRC companies’ overseas listings on July 10.
China formally applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on September 16.
On November 1, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) went into effect and China formally applied to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).
On December 23, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The law prohibits importing goods into the United States that are mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part with forced labor in the PRC, especially from Xinjiang.
On December 27, the National Reform and Development Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) updated its foreign FDI investment “negative lists.”

020622,"2021 Report on International Religious Freedom: China (Includes Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Macau)","The constitution of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which cites the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), states that citizens “enjoy freedom of religious belief” but limits protections for religious practice to “normal religious activities,” without defining “normal.”  The government recognizes five official religions:  Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism, and Catholicism.  Only religious groups belonging to one of the five state-sanctioned “patriotic religious associations” representing these religions are permitted to register with the government and officially permitted to hold worship services, although other groups reported meeting unofficially.  CCP members and members of the armed forces are required to be atheists and are forbidden from engaging in religious practices.  National law prohibits organizations or individuals from interfering with the state educational system for minors younger than the age of 18, effectively barring them from participating in most religious activities or receiving religious education.  Some provinces have additional laws precluding minors’ participation in religious activities.  The government continued to assert control over religion and to restrict the activities and personal freedom of religious adherents that it perceived as threatening state or CCP interests, according to religious groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and international media reports.  NGOs and media continued to report deaths in custody and that the government tortured, physically abused, arrested, disappeared, detained, sentenced to prison, subjected to forced labor and forced indoctrination in CCP ideology, and harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices.  The NGO Human Rights Without Frontiers estimated the government imprisoned 2,987 individuals for exercising their right to freedom of religion or belief as of December 7.  According to Minghui, a Falun Gong-affiliated publication, 101 Falun Gong practitioners died during the year as a result of persecution of their faith, compared with 107 in 2020, and both Minghui and the Falun Dafa Infocenter reported police arrested more than 5,000 practitioners and harassed more than 9,000 others.  According to the annual report of The Church of Almighty God (CAG), authorities arrested more than 11,156 of its members and subjected them to physical abuse, including beatings, sleep deprivation, and being forced into stress positions, resulting in the death of at least nine individuals.  There were reports the government pressured individuals to renounce their religious beliefs.  The government continued its multiyear campaign of “Sinicization” to bring all religious doctrine and practice in line with CCP doctrine, which included requiring clergy of all faiths to attend political indoctrination sessions and suggesting content for sermons that emphasized loyalty to the CCP and the state.  The State Administration of Religious Affairs (SARA) issued regulations, effective May 1, entitled “Administrative Measures for Religious Clergy,” requires all clergy to pledge allegiance to the CCP and socialism and created a database of “religious personnel” to track their performance.  Authorities did not issue a “clergy card” to individuals not belonging to one of the five officially recognized patriotic religious associations, including pastors of Protestant house churches, Catholic clergy who rejected the government’s 2018 provisional agreement with the Holy See and refused to join the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA), teachers and clergy at independent mosques and Buddhist and Taoist temples, rabbis, and religious personnel of new religious movements.  The SARA issued new regulations on September 1 that require all religious schools to teach Xi Jinping Thought and adhere to the “Sinicization of religion.”  The government prohibited private tutors, including those based abroad, from using textbooks “propagating religious teachings” and closed several informal, religiously affiliated schools.

During the year, officials across the country shut down religious venues, including some that were affiliated with the authorized patriotic religious associations, in some but not all cases citing COVID-19 restrictions.  The government intensified its campaign against religious groups it characterized as “cults,” including the CAG, maintained a ban on other groups, such as Falun Gong, and conducted propaganda campaigns against xie jiao (literally “heterodox teachings”) aimed at school-age children.  Authorities limited online worship.  Authorities continued to restrict the printing and distribution of the Bible, the Quran, and other religious literature, and penalized businesses that copied and published religious materials.  The government removed religious apps from app stores and censored religious content from the popular messaging service WeChat.  Authorities censored online posts referencing Jesus or the Bible and there were continued reports that authorities destroyed public displays of religious symbols throughout the country.  The government continued to remove architectural features that identified some churches and mosques as religious sites and removed crosses from private property.  The SARA’s “Administrative Measures for Religious Clergy” made no provision for the Holy See to have a role in the selection of Catholic bishops, despite the 2018 provisional agreement between the Vatican and the government concerning the appointment of bishops.  At a national conference on religious affairs in December, President and CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping called on religious personnel and government officials to “uphold and develop a religious theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics.”

Christians, Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and Falun Gong practitioners reported severe societal discrimination in employment, housing, and business opportunities.  International media reported growing anti-Muslim sentiment in society as a result of the government’s Sinicization campaign.

The Charge d’Affaires and other U.S. embassy and consulate general officials met with a range of government officials to advocate for greater religious freedom and tolerance, and for the release of individuals imprisoned for religious reasons.  The Charge and other embassy and consulate general officials met with members of registered and unregistered religious groups, family members of religious prisoners, NGOs, and others to reinforce U.S. support for religious freedom.  The embassy continued to amplify Department of State religious freedom initiatives and advocacy directly to Chinese citizens through outreach programs and social media.  The U.S. Secretary of State, Charge, and other State Department and embassy officials issued public statements, including via social media, supporting religious freedom and condemning the PRC’s violations of the rights of religious minorities.  The U.S. Secretary of State, Deputy Secretary of State, Charge d’Affaires, and other senior State Department officials and embassy and consulate general representatives repeatedly and publicly expressed concerns about abuses of religious freedom in China, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang.  On January 19, the then Secretary of State determined that since at least March 2017, the PRC has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.  On January 13, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a Withhold Release Order that prohibited the import of all cotton and tomato products produced in Xinjiang.  On March 22, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned two officials under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.  On May 12, the Secretary of State announced visa restrictions against a PRC government official for his involvement in gross violations of human rights against Falun Gong practitioners.  On June 24, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Department of Labor took action against companies in the polysilicon industry using forced labor of religious and ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.  On July 9, the U.S. Commerce Department added to the Entities List 14 Chinese electronics and technology firms and other businesses for helping enable “Beijing’s campaign of repression, mass detention, and high-technology surveillance” against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.  On July 13, the U.S. Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security, and Labor, and the U.S. Trade Representative issued an updated Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory that highlighted for businesses with potential supply chain and investment links to Xinjiang the risk of complicity with forced labor and human rights abuses.  On December 6, the Presidential press secretary announced the United States would not send diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic or Paralympic Games because of human rights abuses in China.  On December 10, the U.S. Department of State imposed visa restrictions on four current and former PRC officials for complicity with human rights violations in Xinjiang, and the U.S. Department of Treasury also sanctioned two officials and one company.  On December 23, the President signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Since 1999, China has been designated as a “Country of Particular Concern” (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.  On November 15, 2021, the Secretary of State redesignated China as a CPC and identified the following sanction that accompanied the designation:  the existing ongoing restriction on exports to China of crime control and detection instruments and equipment, under the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246), pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the Act.

Section I.
Religious Demography

The U.S. government estimates the total population at 1.4 billion (midyear 2021).  According to the State Council Information Office (SCIO) report Seeking Happiness for People:  70 Years of Progress on Human Rights in China, published in September 2019, there are more than 200 million religious adherents in the country.  An SCIO April 2018 white paper on religion in the country states there are approximately 5,500 religious groups.

Local and regional figures for the number of religious followers, including those belonging to the five officially recognized religions, are unclear.  Local governments do not release these statistics, and even official religious organizations do not have accurate numbers.  The Pew Research Center and other observers say the numbers of adherents of many religious groups often are underreported.  The U.S. government estimates that Buddhists comprise 18.2 percent of the country’s total population, Christians 5.1 percent, Muslims 1.8 percent, followers of folk religions 21.9 percent, and atheists or unaffiliated persons 52.2 percent, with Hindus, Jews, and Taoists comprising less than 1 percent.  According to a February 2017 estimate by the U.S.-based NGO Freedom House, there are more than 350 million religious adherents in the country, including 185 to 250 million Buddhists, 60 to 80 million Protestants, 21 to 23 million Muslims, seven to 20 million Falun Gong practitioners, 12 million Roman Catholics, six to eight million Tibetan Buddhists, and hundreds of millions who follow various folk traditions.  According to Boston University’s 2020 World Religion Database, there are 499 million folk and ethnic religionists (34 percent), 474 million agnostics (33 percent), 228 million Buddhists (16 percent), 106 million Christians (7.4 percent), 100 million atheists (7 percent), 23.7 million Muslims (1.7 percent), and other religions adherents who together constitute less than 1 percent of the population, including 5.9 million Taoists, 1.8 million Confucians, 20,500 Sikhs, and 2,900 Jews.  According to the Christian advocacy NGO Open Doors USA’s World Watch List 2022 report, there are 96.7 million Christians.  According to 2015 data from the World Jewish Congress, the country’s Jewish population is 2,500, concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai, and Kaifeng.

The SCIO’s April 2018 white paper found the number of Protestants to be 38 million.  Among these, there are 20 million Protestants affiliated with the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), the state-sanctioned umbrella organization for all officially recognized Protestant churches, according to information on TSPM’s website in March 2017.  The SCIO report states there are six million Catholics, although media and international NGO estimates suggest there are 10-12 million, approximately half of whom practice in churches not affiliated with the CCPA.  Accurate estimates on the numbers of Catholics and Protestants, as well as other faiths, are difficult to calculate because many adherents practice exclusively at home or in churches that are not state sanctioned.

According to the 2018 SCIO white paper, there are 10 ethnic minority groups totaling more than 20 million persons for whom Islam is the majority religion.  Other sources indicate almost all Muslims are Sunni.  The two largest Muslim ethnic minorities are Hui and Uyghur, with Hui Muslims concentrated primarily in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and in Qinghai, Gansu, and Yunnan Provinces.  The SARA, also referred to as the National Religious Affairs Administration, estimates the Muslim Hui population at 10.6 million.  A June report on the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) issued by the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the PRC’s National Bureau of Statistics estimates the total population in Xinjiang is 26 million.  The report states Uyghurs, along with ethnic Kazakh, Hui, Kyrgyz, and members of other predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups, number approximately 15 million residents, or 58 percent of the total population there.

While there is no reliable government breakdown of the Buddhist population by school, the vast majority of Buddhists are adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, according to the Pew Research Center.  Most ethnic Tibetans practice Tibetan Buddhism, although a sizeable minority practices Bon, a pre-Buddhist indigenous religion.

Prior to the government’s 1999 ban on Falun Gong, the government estimated there were 70 million adherents.  Falun Gong sources estimate tens of millions continue to practice privately, and Freedom House estimates there are seven to 20 million practitioners.

Some ethnic minorities follow traditional religions, such as Dongba among the Naxi people in Yunnan Province and Buluotuo among the Zhuang in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.  The central government classifies worship of Mazu, a folk deity with Taoist roots, as an expression of “cultural heritage” rather than a religious practice.",USA

160322,Report to Congress on Access to Tibetan Areas: Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 (8 U.S.C. 1182 note),"This is the fourth annual report under Section 4 of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet
Act of 2018 (8 U.S.C. 1182 note), enacted December 19, 2018, which requires the
Department of State to provide a report to Congress, within 90 days of enactment
and annually thereafter for five years, regarding the level of access PRC authorities
granted to U.S. diplomats and officials, journalists, and tourists to the Tibetan
Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas in China; a comparison with
the level of access granted to other areas of China; a comparison between the
levels of access to Tibetan and non-Tibetan areas in relevant provinces; a
comparison of the level of access compared to the previous reporting year; and a
description of the required permits and other measures that impede travel in
Tibetan areas. This report covers 2021, with comparisons to 2020, as applicable.
The PRC authorities systematically impeded travel to the TAR and to many
Tibetan areas outside the TAR for U.S. diplomats and officials, journalists, and
tourists in 2021. International visitors’ travel to the TAR required the approval of
TAR government travel permits; TAR authorities regularly denied travel permits to
international journalists, diplomats, and other officials often with indications the
central government had denied the request. Approval for tourist travel to the TAR
was easier to secure but often restricted around sensitive dates. U.S. officials
requested via diplomatic note to visit the TAR in February 2021. Despite the
embassy reiterating the request with alternate dates over a six-month period, TAR
authorities did not approve an official visit to the TAR in 2021. The PRC
government hosted two delegations of foreign diplomats from a select group of
countries and a delegation of international journalists in the TAR in 2021. For
diplomats and officials, travel to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR did not require a
permit or special notification beyond the requirements in place for other parts of
China.

PRC authorities routinely denied requests to meet with government, religious, and
civil society leaders in these areas. PRC security forces used conspicuous
monitoring to intimidate U.S. diplomats and officials including while on personal
travel to Tibetan areas, followed them, prevented them from meeting or speaking
with local contacts, harassed them, and restricted their movement in these areas.
Tibetan Americans regularly faced restrictions on their travel to Tibetan areas.
Access to these areas for journalists remained restricted and limited.
Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions and the Suspension of Operations at the
U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in January 2020, PRC authorities have imposed
country-wide restrictions on travel within the country and entry to it, which have
impacted the ability of foreign diplomats, journalists, and tourists to travel to the
TAR and other Tibetan areas. From January to April 2021, the TAR and
surrounding provinces implemented a “closed management” system which heavily
restricted travel to these areas. These restrictions briefly loosened from May to
July 2021, but TAR authorities re-implemented COVID-19 travel restrictions in
August 2021. U.S. journalists reporting in predominately Tibetan-inhabited areas
outside the TAR were detained, harassed, and removed by local security officials,
often under the pretext of COVID-19.
The United States suspended operations at the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu
(CG Chengdu) on July 27, 2020, after the PRC government withdrew consent for
operation in retaliation to the United States’ withdrawal of consent for the
operation of PRC Consulate General in Houston. CG Chengdu had stood at the
center of U.S. relations with people in southwestern China, including in Tibetan
areas, for 35 years. Following suspension of operations, U.S. Embassy Beijing
took responsibility for coverage of Southwest China, including the TAR and
Tibetan areas, more than 800 miles away from Beijing, thereby severely
constraining the United States’ ability to access Tibetan areas. TAR authorities
have not permitted any U.S. embassy visits to the region since the suspension of
operations at CG Chengdu, citing U.S. government sanctions on TAR officials and
the appointment of U.S. officials to TAR-related roles as the reason for rejecting
the requests.

Differences in Access to TAR and Tibetan-Inhabited Areas
While the PRC maintains clear and strict access requirements in order to travel to
the TAR, its access requirements for travel to sensitive Tibetan-inhabited areas in
other provinces remained ambiguous. Tibetan areas, which historically and
currently contain Tibetan populations outside of the TAR, exist in Sichuan, Gansu,
Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces. Municipal and prefecture-level PRC and Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) officials are often responsible for access restrictions to
these areas, making it difficult to determine the rationale and timing for
restrictions.
Level of Access PRC Authorities Granted to U.S. Diplomats and Officials,
Journalists, and Tourists to the TAR, Other Tibetan Areas, and Other Areas
of China
Diplomats and Other Officials
In 2021, the TAR continued to be the only area of China that PRC authorities
required diplomats and other non-PRC officials to request permission to visit.
Diplomats could not purchase air or train tickets to enter the TAR without official
approval. In 2021, the PRC government denied official requests from U.S.
Embassy Beijing for the chargé d'affaires to visit the TAR.
Travel to Tibetan areas outside the TAR continued to be restricted for U.S.
diplomats in 2021. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and provincial authorities
reassured U.S. officials that foreign diplomats were free to travel to Tibetan areas
outside the TAR without the presentation of diplomatic notes. However, the PRC
required diplomats to submit requests to the provincial foreign affairs office (FAO)
in order to conduct meetings with government, religious, and community leaders.
Personal travel by U.S. Mission China personnel to Tibetan areas was closely
monitored and restricted by authorities, with one officer prevented from boarding
an airplane to a Tibetan prefecture and another officer prevented from entering a
Tibetan prefecture that was part of a cycling tour.
U.S. mission personnel did not request American Citizen Services visits to the
TAR in 2021. In the past, local officials in the TAR had been responsive to
consular requests to provide assistance to U.S. citizens but had occasionally
delayed their response on emergency access requests made by U.S. consular
officers.

Tourists
The PRC government regulated travel of international visitors to the TAR for
tourism, a restriction applied by no other provincial-level entity in China. In
accordance with a 1989 central government regulation, international visitors,
including U.S. citizens, were required to obtain an official confirmation letter
issued by the TAR government, which reports to the central government in
Beijing, before entering the TAR. Most tourists received such letters by booking
tours through travel agencies officially registered with the PRC government. The
PRC government mandated a designated tour guide accompany international
tourists while in the TAR. Foreigners rarely obtained permission to enter the TAR
by road. Authorities denied access to the TAR for many international tourists
during periods the PRC government considered politically sensitive, including the
March 2021 anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising against China’s invasion of
Tibet and the Dalai Lama’s birthday in July 2021. Due to COVID-19, PRC
authorities increased travel restrictions in Tibetan areas, particularly from January
through April 2021. Travel restrictions to the TAR during this period applied to all
domestic and international travelers. Restrictions also remain in place for entry of
U.S. citizens and citizens of other foreign counties to the PRC, due to COVID-19.
The PRC government has not provided official data for 2021, though official
media reported 35 million “people-instances” visited the TAR in 2020, a 12.6
percent decrease from 2019. In 2019, CG Chengdu estimated roughly 10,000 U.S.
citizens visited the region. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, U.S. Embassy Beijing
estimates the number of U.S. citizens who visited the TAR has decreased
substantially in 2021.
According to U.S. embassy and consulate contacts, as well as media reports,
Tibetan Americans underwent a stricter screening process than other U.S. citizens
when applying for PRC visas at PRC embassies. Tibetan Americans reported more
frequent harassment by security officials in Tibetan areas than in other parts of
China. Some Tibetan Americans reported they self-censored their behavior in the
United States out of fear of retribution against their family members in Tibet or
fear of losing future access to Tibet.
Journalists
PRC regulations require formal permission for foreign journalists to enter the
TAR, but do not have the same formal process for other parts of China. The PRC
continued to heavily restrict and control access for U.S. journalists to the TAR.

According to the 2021 annual report of the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China
(FCCC), the PRC government denied the requests of all four of the foreign
journalists who applied for permission to travel to the TAR in 2021. Foreign
journalists were allowed to travel to the TAR on PRC government-organized press
tours. The tours were by invitation only, allowing PRC officials to select specific
journalists. Those who were selected were closely watched and prevented from
visiting locations or meeting people other than those presented by PRC officials
hosting the tour. In May 2021, the PRC State Council Information Office
organized a highly-scripted trip to the TAR for journalists from AP, Reuters, AFP,
Tokyo Radio, and Russia Today to cover the commemoration of the PRC’s 70th
anniversary of the “peaceful liberation of Tibet.” U.S. Embassy Beijing and the
FCCC are not aware of any other reporting trips by foreign journalists to the TAR
in 2021.
When U.S. journalists gained access to Tibetan areas, the PRC government further
suppressed their ability to report about Tibet by intimidating and preventing its
citizens from interacting with foreign press. Under social media laws implemented
by the TAR government, Tibetans can be imprisoned for “inappropriate
communication,” particularly with foreigners. By hosting group tours, the
government was able to cite increased numbers and greater access to the region
while maintaining strict control over the information conveyed.
Comparison Between Levels of Access to Tibetan and Non-Tibetan Areas in
Relevant Provinces
Diplomats and Other Officials
The PRC government permitted U.S. diplomats and other officials to travel to
Tibetan areas outside of the TAR without submitting prior notification, though
official meetings with local government, religious, and community leaders required
local FAO permission as was common practice in many localities throughout
China. PRC security personnel used conspicuous monitoring to intimidate those
traveling to Tibetan areas outside of the TAR. Government-designated minders
followed diplomats and officials, prevented them from meeting or speaking with
local contacts, questioned them, and restricted their movement. Official access to
monasteries in Tibetan areas of Kardze (Chinese: Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture (TAP) in Sichuan province and Ngaba (Chinese: Aba) TAP in Sichuan
province remained restricted. U.S. officials who traveled to Tibetan areas outside
the TAR required significant advance approval to secure official meetings with
local government officials and religious leaders.

Provincial officials denied most of these requests. During visits to Tibetan areas in
Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Yunnan provinces, local authorities prohibited U.S.
diplomats from entering certain monasteries, blocked off specific roads, prevented
them from having meetings or conversations, and monitored their conversations.
Tourists
International tourists sometimes faced restrictions traveling to Tibetan areas
outside the TAR. U.S. tourists reported authorities regularly denied tourist access
to the TAR during periods the PRC government considered politically sensitive,
such as around the Dalai Lama’s birthday in July. U.S. business representatives
and other U.S. citizens reported increased monitoring and harassment from
security officials while traveling in Tibetan areas outside the TAR.
Journalists
Although journalists were permitted to travel to areas outside the TAR with
significant Tibetan populations, they were subjected to invasive surveillance,
physically blocked from certain areas, and intimidated by the government.
According to the FCCC’s 2021 report, one U.S. journalist was blocked from
entering Kardze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan. Other U.S.
correspondents were removed from Tibetan areas of Sichuan by police and
detained in Chengdu, even when covering non-sensitive stories.
Comparison of the Level of Access Between 2020 and 2021
Diplomats and Other Officials
Access to the Tibetan population of the PRC by diplomats and other officials did
not improve in 2021 compared to 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Restrictions in Tibetan areas of Sichuan province, while less conspicuous, were
equally pervasive. Security officials quickly broke up attempts by U.S. officials to
speak with locals in the TAR and in Tibetan areas of Sichuan and Qinghai
provinces. These actions were consistent with the procedures of prior years,
including 2019, when security officials prevented many Tibetans from attending a
March lunch hosted by CG Chengdu. Tibetans who interacted with U.S. diplomats
afterwards reported questioning and harassment by security officials. U.S.
diplomats’ cultural events and outreach to Tibetans experienced frequent
government objections to content and forced changes of venue.

The Nepali ambassador to the PRC visited Lhasa, where Nepal maintains a small
consulate, in September 2021. A few diplomats from other missions were
approved to visit in a personal capacity in March 2021.
Journalists
The FCCC’s 2020 annual report stated that six out of eight journalists who
requested to report from Tibetan-inhabited areas were told by authorities that
reporting was either restricted or prohibited. The 2021 FCCC report noted that
none of the four foreign journalists who applied for permission to visit the TAR in
2021 were approved. In 2021, foreign correspondents continued to experience
harassment while reporting in Tibetan regions of Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai, and
Yunnan provinces.
Required Permits and Other Measures Impeding Freedom to Travel in
Tibetan Areas
In addition to the permits and other restrictions described above, visitors who
received a Tibet travel permit still faced additional access barriers once in the
TAR. According to travel agents operating in the TAR, the Tibet travel permit did
not allow visits to all areas. Some areas were generally closed to visitors and
required an additional alien travel permit from the TAR Public Security Bureau.
Tourists planning to visit certain border areas also required a military area entry
permit from the Military Affairs Office and a foreign affairs permit from the TAR
FAO.
The PRC government did not disclose its decision-making process for granting
permission to travel to the TAR, nor did it share the names of officials involved in
issuing travel permits to U.S. citizens to visit the TAR.
PRC authorities routinely assess each U.S. official request to visit the TAR on a
case-by-case basis. The TAR FAO generally required a diplomatic note for any
official visit, accompanied by a detailed day-by-day agenda and list of trip
attendees. Once the TAR government received the request, it reportedly informed
a foreign affairs leading committee, consisting of representatives at the prefectural,
provincial, and central levels from the United Front Work Department, Ministry of
State Security, Ministry of Public Security, People’s Liberation Army, and
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This committee reviewed the request and then
instructed the TAR FAO to provide CG Chengdu or U.S. Embassy Beijing with a
formal response. This process typically took at least one month.",USA

L. 116-149), not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of the HKAA, if the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines that a foreign person is materially contributing to, has materially contributed to, or attempts to materially contribute to the failure of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to meet its obligations under the Sino – British Joint Declaration (“Joint Declaration”) or Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate Congressional committees and leadership a report that includes (1) an identification of the foreign person; and (2) a clear explanation for why the foreign person was identified and a description of the activity that resulted in the identification.  Pursuant to Section 5(e) of the Act, the report is to be updated in an on-going manner.

The Act sets out specific consequences for the foreign persons listed in this report.  Pursuant to Section 6 of the Act, not later than one year from the date of this report, the President shall impose certain blocking sanctions on the listed persons and subject them to visa restrictions and exclusion from the United States.  Furthermore, pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Act, not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days following the submission of this report, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit a report to Congress that identifies any foreign financial institution (FFI) that knowingly conducts a significant transaction with the foreign persons listed in this report.  Pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Act, within one year of their inclusion in the Secretary of the Treasury’s report, the Act mandates that the President impose not fewer than five out of 10 of the sanctions set out in Section 7(b) on any FFI identified pursuant to Section 5(b).  These include (1) restrictions on loans from U.S. financial institutions; (2) prohibitions on designation as a primary dealer; (3) prohibitions on service as a repository of government funds; (4) restrictions on  foreign exchange; (5) prohibitions on banking transactions; (6) prohibitions on property transactions; (7) restrictions on exports, re–exports, and transfers; (8) bans on investments in equity or debt; (9) exclusions of corporate officers; and (10) sanctions of principal executive officers.  Not later than two years after an FFI has been included in the Secretary of the Treasury’s report, the President is required to impose all the sanctions set out in Section 7(b) of the Act.

The State Department has publicly condemned the erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, including those protected under the Joint Declaration and Basic Law.  These developments include fundamental changes to the Hong Kong political system that reduce the proportion of directly elected seats in the Legislative Council and introduce a strict, multi-tiered vetting system that gives Beijing effective veto power, without judicial oversight, over opposition candidates’ ability to run for office.  The PRC has disqualified sitting moderate and pro-democracy lawmakers and delayed legislative elections.  In January 2021, Hong Kong authorities arrested 55 opposition politicians for participating in or organizing primary elections the previous summer.  Hong Kong authorities have placed pressure on the judiciary.  Judges appointed to oversee national security cases have denied bail and jury trials.

The PRC has undermined press and academic freedom to silence critics.  Hong Kong police have arrested and prosecuted journalists in connection with their duties as reporters.  In June 2021, Hong Kong authorities forced the closure of newspaper Apple Daily, a bastion of independent journalism, and arrested members of its staff.  The public broadcaster, Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), required staff to pledge a loyalty oath to the PRC, and refused to air reporting on politically sensitive topics.  Schools now integrate “national security education” into all aspects of their curriculum, limiting free speech in education, suppressing the academic freedom of teachers, and prompting some educators to resign.  Hong Kong authorities instituted oath-taking requirements for civil servants, prompting more than 100 to refuse and resulting in their suspension.

Authorities have arrested or detained thousands of Hong Kong residents for speaking out against their government’s policies.  Authorities have also detained individuals for the publication of books and articles that conflict with the priorities of the Hong Kong government, including children’s books.  In addition, Hong Kong authorities put pressure on civil society organizations, denying residents permission to organize vigils to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, arrested people for social media posts related to their individual efforts to commemorate the massacre, and accused the leaders of Hong Kong’s June 4 Museum of operating an illegal establishment, leading to its closure.

The actions described above demonstrate that the PRC continues to undermine Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and that foreign persons have materially contributed to the failure of the PRC to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration and Basic Law, as defined in Section 5(g) of the Act.

Foreign Persons Materially Contributing to the Failure of the PRC to Meet Its Obligations Under the Joint Declaration and Basic Law

On October 14, 2020, the Secretary of State submitted a report to Congress pursuant to section 5(a) of the HKAA, which listed 10 foreign persons that the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determined are materially contributing to, have materially contributed to, or attempted to materially contribute to the failure of the PRC to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law, as this is defined by section 5(g) of the HKAA.  On March 16, 2021, the Department of State submitted a report listing an additional 24 foreign persons determined to meet the HKAA criteria.  This report is an update to the October 2020 and March 2021 reports, consistent with section 5(e) of the HKAA.

Pursuant to section 5(a) of the HKAA, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, has determined the five foreign persons listed below are materially contributing to, have materially contributed to, or attempt to materially contribute to the failure of the PRC to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law, as defined in section 5(g) of the HKAA.  As also required under section 5(a), the list below includes (1) an identification of the foreign person; and (2) a clear explanation for why the foreign person was identified and a description of the activity that resulted in the identification.  The Secretary of State previously designated the individuals listed in this report as subject to blocking sanctions under Executive Order (E.O.) 13936 on July 16, 2021, and the Department of the Treasury added them to its List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.  Individuals designated under E.O. 13936 are also subject to visa restrictions under section 7 of that order.

161221,Country Reports on Terrorism 2020: China (Hong Kong and Macau),"Overview:  The PRC response to terrorism remained difficult to distinguish from the government and ruling Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) suppression of peaceful activities that authorities deemed separatist or subversive in nature.  The PRC’s counterterrorism attention remained on ethnic Uyghur so-called extremists, specifically alleging that the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) is the primary source of terrorism in Xinjiang.  The United States, however, has seen no credible evidence for more than a decade that the group still exists and removed ETIM from the Terrorist Exclusion List in November based on this lack of evidence.  The United States continued to list ETIM as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224 to maintain compliance with its obligations under the UN 1267 Committee.  Beijing inaccurately labeled the “Turkistan Islamic Party” (TIP) as ETIM.  TIP is a violent extremist group active in Syria and Afghanistan that shares some characteristics with the PRC’s description of ETIM.  Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities have faced extreme oppression at the hands of China’s authoritarian government, which has used counterterrorism as a pretext to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.  The PRC since 2017 has detained more than one million predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other religious and ethnic minority groups in internment camps, where officials subject them to torture, forced labor, persecution, and coercive family planning, among other abuses.  The PRC continued to expand law enforcement tools and enhance its military and counterterrorism capabilities to justify and improve its ability to carry out this repressive campaign, respond to threats faced as a result of the PRC’s increasing global economic footprint, and garner international support for its counterterrorism-related policies.

2020 Terrorist Incidents:  PRC officials maintain that no violent terrorist incidents have occurred in the country since 2016 owing to their Xinjiang policies.

Chinese citizens abroad were affected by terrorist attacks not specifically directed against PRC policies:

On February 6, Islamic State sympathizers in the Maldives stabbed three persons, including two Chinese citizens.  On November 2, a Chinese citizen was killed and another person of Chinese ethnicity injured by a gunman in a terrorist attack in Vienna, Austria, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility.  Four persons were killed and 23 injured in the Vienna attack.
International terrorist-related incidents targeting China and its interests also occurred in 2020 involving PRC infrastructure projects associated with the One Belt One Road initiative.

In October, four Pakistani military and private security personnel guarding Chinese facilities related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the One Belt One Road initiative were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists.
Legislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:  The PRC continued to advance and defend its policies on fighting terrorism, which included the use of political “re-education” camps in Xinjiang under the guise of vocational training and education centers.  Authorities forced  detainees to learn Communist Party ideology, Mandarin Chinese, and ideas to counter “extremist thinking.”  International media reported on the expansion of these camps and on the continued mass transfer of Uyghur workers both within Xinjiang and to other provinces in China to fill labor shortages, and described draconian detention conditions in the facilities, including torture.  A September State Council white paper on Xinjiang, however, lauded the PRC’s poverty alleviation efforts in Xinjiang as a successful model for combating terrorism.  Throughout the year, the PRC continued to enhance and develop its military and counterterrorism capabilities as well as leverage its domestic technology sector to bolster surveillance capabilities, including for counterterrorism goals.

In 2020, to meet various UNSCR requirements, the Chinese government began collecting Passenger Name Record data and has collected Advance Passenger Information data since 2019.

Countering the Financing of Terrorism:  The PRC is a member of FATF, APG, and the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (EAG).  China served as FATF president from July 2019 to July 2020.  Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa (BRICS) regularly cooperate on the topic of terrorist financing and have proposed institutionalizing the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) BRICS Council.

Countering Violent Extremism:  The PRC continued to implement broad repressive campaigns in Xinjiang under the guise of countering what the Chinese government called extremism, including mass “re-education” and “vocational training” of Uyghurs and other Muslims.  The United States assesses the goal of these policies is to repress and Sinicize religious minorities.  CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a keynote address at the Third CCP Central Symposium on Work related to Xinjiang in September, in which he said the CCP should continue to promote the Sinicization of Islam in Xinjiang.  The PRC government’s broad definitions of terrorism, conflation of the exercise of freedom of religion or belief and violent extremism, as well as its unclear definition of “cyber terrorism,” continued to raise human rights concerns.  The Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices contains further information on the topic.

Regional and International Cooperation:  The PRC continued to promote the United Nations as the primary international forum for counterterrorism, where it actively advances a repressive approach to counterterrorism.  It engaged in a range of multilateral, regional, and bilateral fora, presenting itself as a global leader on counterterrorism.  China continued to work through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure to pursue counterterrorism cooperation, including joint border operations, drills, and youth deradicalization efforts.  In September, BRICS held a fifth Counterterrorism Working Group meeting and in November unveiled a new counterterrorism strategy.  In bilateral and multilateral fora, the PRC cited terrorism concerns to counter international criticism of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and to justify repatriation requests and other law enforcement actions overseas.  The PRC engages through bilateral channels with a variety of governments to aggressively lobby the forcible return of Uyghur and other ethnic and religious minority asylum seekers who fled repression in Xinjiang, often labeling these individuals as terrorists or violent extremists.  During the year, units from the People’s Liberation Army and the People’s Armed Police held CT drills with a range of countries, including the September Kavkaz-2020 multinational antiterror strategic exercise in Russia.

041121,2021 END Wildlife Trafficking Report,"The Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt (END) Wildlife Trafficking Act (P.L. 114-231; 16 U.S.C. §§ 7601-7644) (the Act) directs the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, to submit to Congress a report that lists Focus Countries and Countries of Concern, as defined in the Act. 

Wildlife trafficking remains a serious transnational crime that threatens security, economic prosperity, the rule of law, long-standing conservation efforts, and human health. E.O. 13773 of February 9, 2017, called for a comprehensive and decisive approach to dismantle organized crime syndicates and specifically recognized the connection between wildlife trafficking and transnational criminal organizations. 

The Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking (Task Force), co-chaired by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney General, brings together 17 federal departments and agencies to implement the National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking (the “National Strategy”). The USG’s three-pronged approach to combating wildlife trafficking – strengthening law enforcement, reducing demand, and building international cooperation – deprives criminals of a key source of financing, reducing the criminal threat posed to U.S. citizens. 

The Task Force’s work to combat wildlife trafficking is making a difference on the ground at home and worldwide. Task Force efforts and activities are better coordinated across the USG: efficiencies are identified and leveraged, redundancies eliminated, and resources used more strategically; international outreach continues to expand; and improved intelligence has identified new areas of work and opportunities for U.S. engagement. Working in partnership with the private sector, local communities, and NGOs, the United States has led the way globally, securing agreements and commitments from governments and stakeholders to take urgent action at all levels. Highlights of Task Force efforts are included in the separate strategic review, as called for in Sec. 301(d) of the Act.

To improve accountability and reporting on strategy implementation, the Task Force developed several indicators for monitoring USG-supported actions to address wildlife trafficking in Focus Countries. These indicators are designed to measure inputs, outputs, or outcomes of law enforcement capacity building and cooperation efforts, policy reform, and demand reduction actions tailored to each country. They also measure dimensions of how seriously wildlife crime is perceived or addressed in each country. U.S. missions in all 28 Focus Countries reported indicator data in 2020. Almost every post reported supporting host country wildlife law enforcement efforts with training or other resources in 2020. Twenty-five of 28 posts reported seizures of assets, proceeds, and illegal wildlife or wildlife products by law enforcement authorities. Twenty-two of 28 posts reported data on arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of wildlife traffickers. The Task Force also obtained data on demand reduction indicators for 14 of the 28 Focus Countries. In total, USG demand reduction efforts for illegal wildlife products reached an estimated 226 million people in 17 Focus Countries. 

Focus Countries[1] 

Methodology for Determining Focus Countries 

State worked closely with the other agencies of the Task Force to employ both qualitative and quantitative information to identify Focus Countries and Countries of Concern, as defined in Section 2 of the Act, for the 2017 END Act Report. Technical experts and scientists from Task Force agencies established a process to analyze wildlife trafficking information and gathered a set of relevant and available data. This analysis included evaluation of data drawn from public reporting by USG agencies, international entities such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and the UN Office of Drugs and Crime, as well as NGOs such as the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, TRAFFIC, the Environmental Investigation Agency, and Transparency International. Information from the required national assessments reinforced and augmented our previous findings. 

Task Force agencies, including those represented at U.S. missions overseas, reviewed the initial analysis and provided additional information that was often only available locally. These country-specific analyses helped to round out the global data, including by providing information on additional species such as felines, primates, and marine species. Agencies also considered the trajectory of wildlife populations and the impacts of trafficking, government, and private sector efforts to prevent illegal trade, and the presence of legal or poorly regulated domestic markets for species threatened by wildlife trafficking. 

The Task Force further evaluated whether governments had recently taken steps to improve legislation, regulations, and/or enforcement and other trends such that the country is increasing its efforts to combat the illegal trade in wildlife. Subsequent to the initial 26 Focus Countries identified in the 2017 and 2018 reports, the 2019 report listed an additional two Focus Countries. No Focus Countries were added or removed in 2020 or 2021. 

2021 Focus Countries 

State, in consultation with the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, and with USAID, agreed that all 28 of the countries and jurisdictions listed as Focus Countries in the 2020 END Act Report should remain listed. Each country previously listed continues to be a “major source of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, a major transit point of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, or a major consumer of wildlife trafficking products,” and designation appears to have contributed to increased attention to combating wildlife trafficking in some Focus Countries. 

This determination is based on analysis of the statutory criteria in the Act and does not reflect a positive or negative judgment of the listed countries or indicate that these countries are not working diligently to combat wildlife trafficking. Indeed, the United States has longstanding partnerships with many of these countries with respect to combating wildlife trafficking and recognizes the strong political will that already exists in many of these countries to tackle this problem. State and other Task Force agencies look forward to continuing close and constructive relationships with these countries as we work collaboratively to combat wildlife trafficking. No new focus countries were added. 

Consistent with Section 301 of the Act, U.S. missions in each Focus Country developed a strategic plan based on the U.S. mission’s assessment of wildlife trafficking within that country. U.S. agencies used the strategic plans to guide and coordinate USG approaches and responses to the needs and gaps identified in the assessment. The Task Force co-chairs, along with USAID, developed and distributed templates for both the assessments and strategic plans. All Task Force agencies, both at post and in Washington, were invited to contribute to their development. The Task Force reviewed the assessments and strategic plans for completeness and consistency, recognizing variability based on location, resources within the U.S. mission, and previous engagement in the issue. 

U.S. missions in all Focus Countries have completed their assessments and strategic plans. Together these documents provide an overview of the issues related to wildlife trafficking in that country, identify key areas for strategic intervention by the USG, and either establish a new platform or support existing structures within the mission to guide a coordinated, “whole of USG” approach to interventions.

Countries of Concern 

2021 Countries of Concern 

To identify Countries of Concern among the 28 Focus Countries as directed by Section 201(b) of the Act, State, in consultation with the Departments of the Interior and Commerce and with USAID, reviewed publicly available information as well as classified material that indicated that governments actively engaged in or knowingly profited from the trafficking of endangered or threatened species. In 2020, no Countries of Concern were removed from the list, and Cambodia, Cameroon, and Nigeria were added. There were no changes to this list in 2021. This designation does not indicate that all parts of the government are or have been involved in wildlife trafficking, but that there are serious concerns that either high-level or systemic government involvement has occurred. The Task Force will, among other things, ensure that USG agencies coordinate efforts among U.S. federal agencies and non-federal partners to implement the U.S. mission strategic plans developed in accordance with section 301 of the Act, with a view to supporting these countries and their governments to reduce trade in and consumer demand for illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products.

210721,2021 Investment Climate Statements: China,"In 2020, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) became the top global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) destination. As the world’s second-largest economy, with a large consumer base and integrated supply chains, China’s economic recovery following COVID-19 reassured investors and contributed to higher FDI and portfolio investments. In 2020, China took significant steps toward implementing commitments made to the United States on a wide range of IP issues and made some modest openings in its financial sector. China also concluded key trade agreements and implemented important legislation, including the Foreign Investment Law (FIL).

China remains, however, a relatively restrictive investment environment for foreign investors due to restrictions in key economic sectors. Obstacles to investment include ownership caps and requirements to form joint venture partnerships with local Chinese firms, industrial policies such as Made in China 2025 (MIC 2025) that target development of indigenous capacity, as well as pressure on U.S. firms to transfer technology as a prerequisite to gaining market access. PRC COVID-19 visa and travel restrictions significantly affected foreign businesses operations increasing their labor and input costs. Moreover, an increasingly assertive Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and emphasis on national companies and self-reliance has heightened foreign investors’ concerns about the pace of economic reforms.

Key investment announcements and new developments in 2020 included:

On January 1, the FIL went into effect and effectively replaced previous laws governing foreign investment.

On January 15, the U.S. and China concluded the Economic and Trade Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the People’s Republic of China (the Phase One agreement). Under the agreement, China committed to reforms in its intellectual property regime, prohibit forced transfer technology as a condition for market access, and made some openings in the financial and energy sector. China also concluded the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement on November 15 and reached a political agreement with the EU on the China-EU Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) on December 30.

In mid-May, PRC leader Xi Jinping announced China’s “dual circulation” strategy, intended to make China less export-oriented and more focused on the domestic market.

On June 23, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced new investment “negative lists” to guide foreign FDI.

Market openings were coupled, however, with restrictions on investment, such as the Rules on Security Reviews on Foreign Investments – China’s revised investment screening mechanism.

While Chinese pronouncements of greater market access and fair treatment of foreign investment are welcome, details and effective implementation are still needed to ensure foreign investors truly experience equitable treatment.",USA

Reports on Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet, and Xinjiang are appended at the end of this report.

The constitution of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which cites the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), states that citizens “enjoy freedom of religious belief” but limits protections for religious practice to “normal religious activities” without defining “normal.” CCP members and members of the armed forces are required to be atheists and are forbidden from engaging in religious practices. National law prohibits organizations or individuals from interfering with the state educational system for minors younger than the age of 18, effectively barring them from participating in most religious activities or receiving religious education. Some provinces have additional laws on minors’ participation in religious activities. The government continued to assert control over religion and restrict the activities and personal freedom of religious adherents that it perceived as threatening state or CCP interests, according to religious groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and international media reports. The government recognizes five official religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism, and Catholicism. Only religious groups belonging to one of the five state-sanctioned “patriotic religious associations” representing these religions are permitted to register with the government and officially permitted to hold worship services. There continued to be reports of deaths in custody and that the government tortured, physically abused, arrested, detained, sentenced to prison, subjected to forced indoctrination in CCP ideology, or harassed adherents of both registered and unregistered religious groups for activities related to their religious beliefs and practices. According to Minghui, a Falun Gong publication, police arrested more than 6,600 Falun Gong practitioners during the year. According to the annual report of The Church of the Almighty God (CAG), authorities arrested more than 7,000 of its members and subjected them to physical abuse, including beatings, sleep deprivation, and being forced into stress positions. The CAG reported some individuals died in custody or as a result of police harassment. Bitter Winter, an online publication that tracks religious liberty and human rights abuses in the country, reported instances of individuals being held for extended periods of time in psychiatric hospitals for practicing their religious beliefs, where authorities beat them and forced them to take medication. Authorities detained and arrested religious leaders trying to hold services online. The government continued its 2019-2024 campaign of “Sinicization” to bring all religious doctrine and practice in line with CCP doctrine, including by requiring clergy of all faiths to attend political indoctrination sessions, monitoring religious services, preapproving sermons, and altering religious texts, including, according to media, stories from the life of Jesus, to emphasize loyalty to the CCP and the State. In September, United Front Work Department (UFWD) vice head and State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA) director general Wang Zuo’an announced foreign influence and control had been completely eliminated from Christianity in China. The government offered financial incentives to law enforcement to arrest religious practitioners and to citizens who reported “illegal religious activity.” The government continued its campaign against religious groups it characterized as “cults,” including the CAG, and maintained a ban on other groups, such as Falun Gong. From January to July, officials across the country shut down religious venues, including some that were affiliated with the authorized patriotic religious associations, in some but not all cases citing COVID restrictions. There were reports the government used the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to increase the surveillance and arrest of religious practitioners, including members of state-sanctioned groups, and to curtail private worship among religious groups. Authorities continued to restrict the printing and distribution of the Bible, Quran, and other religious literature, and penalized publishing and copying businesses that handled religious materials. Authorities censored online posts referencing Jesus or the Bible. There were numerous reports that authorities closed or destroyed Islamic, Christian, Buddhist, and Taoist houses of worship and destroyed public displays of religious symbols throughout the country. The government removed architectural features that identified churches and mosques as religious sites. It altered textbooks to delete references to religious holidays. Officials routinely made public statements denigrating the Dalai Lama. In October, the Holy See extended for another two years its 2018 provisional agreement with the government concerning the appointment of bishops. Critics stated the agreement did not alleviate government pressure on Catholic clergy to join the state-sponsored Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association (CCPA).

Christians, Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and Falun Gong practitioners reported severe societal discrimination in employment, housing, and business opportunities. In Xinjiang and Tibet, authorities continued to suppress Uyghur and Tibetan language and culture, while promoting ethnic Han individuals in political, economic, and cultural life. Anti-Muslim speech in social media remained widespread.

In multiple public speeches, the U.S. Secretary of State criticized the government for curtailing religious freedom. In an October speech on tolerance given while visiting Indonesia, the Secretary said, “The gravest threat to the future of religious freedom is the Chinese Communist Party’s war against people of all faiths: Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, and Falun Gong practitioners alike.” The Ambassador and other U.S. embassy and consulate general officials met with a range of government officials to advocate for greater religious freedom and tolerance, and for the release of individuals imprisoned for religious reasons. The Ambassador and other embassy and consulate general officials met with members of registered and unregistered religious groups, family members of religious prisoners, NGOs, and others to reinforce U.S. support for religious freedom. The embassy continued to amplify Department of State religious freedom initiatives directly to Chinese citizens through outreach programs and social media.

On June 17, the President signed into law the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 authorizing the imposition of U.S. sanctions, including asset blocking and denial of visas, against Chinese officials responsible for the detention and persecution of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. In July, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on four Chinese leaders and additional PRC entities pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. During the year, the U.S. government added 20 PRC entities to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List that were implicated in human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The U.S. imposed visa restrictions on government and CCP officials for their responsibility for, or complicity in, human rights abuses in Xinjiang. When announcing the visa restrictions, the Secretary of State said, “The United States will not stand idly by as the CCP carries out human rights abuses targeting Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang, to include forced labor, arbitrary mass detention, and forced population control, and attempts to erase their culture and Muslim faith.” The U.S. also prohibited import of merchandise believed to have been produced in Xinjiang with forced labor. At the direction of the Secretary of State, U.S. government officials explored whether the PRC’s actions in Xinjiang constituted atrocities, namely crimes against humanity and genocide. The process was ongoing at year’s end.*

Since 1999, China has been designated as a “Country of Particular Concern” (CPC) under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom. On December 2, 2020 the Secretary of State redesignated China as a CPC and identified the following sanction that accompanied the designation: the existing ongoing restriction on exports to China of crime control and detection instruments and equipment, under the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246), pursuant to section 402(c)(5) of the Act.",USA
300321,"2020 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: China (Includes Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibet)","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The People’s Republic of China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority. Communist Party members hold almost all top government and security apparatus positions. Ultimate authority rests with the Communist Party Central Committee’s 25-member Political Bureau (Politburo) and its seven-member Standing Committee. Xi Jinping continued to hold the three most powerful positions as party general secretary, state president, and chairman of the Central Military Commission.

The main domestic security agencies include the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Public Security, and the People’s Armed Police. The People’s Armed Police continue to be under the dual authority of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Central Military Commission. The People’s Liberation Army is primarily responsible for external security but also has some domestic security responsibilities. Local jurisdictions also frequently use civilian municipal security forces, known as “urban management” officials, to enforce administrative measures. Civilian authorities maintained effective control of the security forces. Members of the security forces committed serious and pervasive abuses.

Genocide and crimes against humanity occurred during the year against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. These crimes were continuing and include: the arbitrary imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty of more than one million civilians; forced sterilization, coerced abortions, and more restrictive application of China’s birth control policies; rape; torture of a large number of those arbitrarily detained; forced labor; and the imposition of draconian restrictions on freedom of religion or belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement.

Significant human rights issues included: arbitrary or unlawful killings by the government; forced disappearances by the government; torture by the government; harsh and life-threatening prison and detention conditions; arbitrary detention by the government, including the mass detention of more than one million Uyghurs and other members of predominantly Muslim minority groups in extrajudicial internment camps and an additional two million subjected to daytime-only “re-education” training; political prisoners; politically motivated reprisal against individuals outside the country; the lack of an independent judiciary and Communist Party control over the judicial and legal system; arbitrary interference with privacy; pervasive and intrusive technical surveillance and monitoring; serious restrictions on free expression, the press, and the internet, including physical attacks on and criminal prosecution of journalists, lawyers, writers, bloggers, dissidents, petitioners, and others as well as their family members, and censorship and site blocking; interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including overly restrictive laws that apply to foreign and domestic nongovernmental organizations; severe restrictions and suppression of religious freedom; substantial restrictions on freedom of movement; refoulement of asylum seekers to North Korea, where they have a well founded fear of persecution; the inability of citizens to choose their government; restrictions on political participation; serious acts of corruption; forced sterilization and coerced abortions; forced labor and trafficking in persons; severe restrictions on labor rights, including a ban on workers organizing or joining unions of their own choosing; and child labor.

Government officials and the security services often committed human rights abuses with impunity. Authorities often announced investigations following cases of reported killings by police but did not announce results or findings of police malfeasance or disciplinary action.",USA

061223,Wang Yi Has a Phone Call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken,"On December 6, 2023, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken at the latter's request.

Antony J. Blinken thanked Wang Yi for visiting the U.S. Embassy in China to mourn the passing of former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Wang Yi said, Dr. Henry Kissinger always advocated that China and the United States, two major countries, should respect each other, progress together and fulfill their due international responsibilities. Dr. Henry Kissinger repeatedly stressed that the United States should fully understand the importance of the Taiwan question to China, and the diplomatic legacy left by him is worth being carried forward and developed by future generations.

Wang Yi said, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a successful meeting in San Francisco and set a future-oriented ""San Francisco vision"", which is of milestone significance. The current important task of the two sides is to continue the positive effects of the San Francisco summit meeting, deliver on the common understandings reached by the two heads of state, consolidate the momentum of stability in China-U.S. relations, and improve and develop China-U.S. relations in the sound, stable and sustainable direction. This is the common interests of China and the United States, and also the responsibility of the two major countries.

Wang Yi once again stressed China's solemn position on the Taiwan question, urging the United States not to interfere in China's internal affairs and not to support or connive with any ""Taiwan independence"" forces.

The two sides had an exchange of views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and agreed to maintain communication on the situation in the Middle East. Wang Yi said that the most pressing task is to stop fighting and end hostilities immediately. At the crossroads of war and peace, major countries, in particular, should stick to fairness and justice, uphold objectivity and impartiality, show calmness and rationality, and make all-out efforts to deescalate the situation, and prevent a larger humanitarian disaster. Any solution to the current crisis in Gaza must not deviate from the two-state solution, and any arrangement concerning the future of Palestine must reflect the will of the Palestinian people. The Chinese side holds that the core of the solution is to respect Palestine's right to statehood and self-determination, and embody the principle of ""Palestinian-owned, Palestinian-led and Palestinian-administered"". China is ready to work with all parties to make efforts to this end.

181123,"Steering the Wheel of China-U.S. Relations and Piloting Asia-Pacific Cooperation
- Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi Talks About President Xi Jinping's Visit to the United States for the China-U.S. Summit Meeting and the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting","From November 14 to 17, 2023, at the invitation of President of the United States Joe Biden, President Xi Jinping held a China-U.S. summit meeting in San Francisco of the United States and attended upon invitation the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. As the agenda was wrapped up, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi briefed accompanying journalists on the visit.

Wang Yi said that the world is currently undergoing changes unseen in a century, and humanity is at a crucial turning point in history. The people of the two countries show great care for and the international community closely follows where China-U.S. relations will be heading. This year marks the 30th gathering of APEC leaders, and all parties are thinking deeply about where Asia-Pacific cooperation will be heading in the next 30 years. At such an important juncture, President Xi Jinping flew across the Pacific Ocean to start his journey in San Francisco. President Xi Jinping held a meeting with President Joe Biden to discuss the right way forward for China and the United States to get along with each other. President Xi had interactions and exchanges with all walks of life in the United States to pool consensus for friendly cooperation between the two countries. He attended the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting to chart the course for Asia-Pacific cooperation. International commentary described that the visit has been world-recognized, yielded fruitful outcomes, and been of far-reaching implications, increasing stability in China-U.S. relations, bringing new impetus to Asia-Pacific cooperation, and injecting positive energy into international and regional landscapes, and showing President Xi Jinping's leadership as a farsighted head of a major country with a global vision.

I. Charting the course for China-U.S. relations in the new era

Wang Yi said that since the beginning of this year, China-U.S. relations have undergone some twists and turns and been faced with difficulties due to some widely known reasons, which is not in alignment with the interests and aspirations of the people of the two countries. Through concerted efforts of the two sides, China-U.S. relations have recently shown the sign of stopping falling and becoming stabilized. When holding the APEC meeting, President Joe Biden sent a special invitation to President Xi Jinping to hold a summit. The U.S. emphasized that this is a China-U.S. summit, different from arrangements of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the APEC meeting. All walks of life in the United States and the international community have full expectations of the summit, with the prevailing hope that the two countries will earnestly return to what was agreed at the Bali summit and embark on the journey to San Francisco. President Xi Jinping, with his keen grasp of the trend of the times, went to the United States upon invitation to promote once again the stability and improvement of China-U.S. relations at the historical juncture.

This is President Xi Jinping's visit to the United States after six years, and the other face-to-face summit between the two heads of state since their meeting in Bali last November. President Joe Biden selected with consideration the Filoli Estate as the venue of the summit. Besides formal talks, President Joe Biden also hosted a luncheon for President Xi Jinping, and invited President Xi Jinping to take a walk at the Filoli Estate. The summit lasted for 4 hours. In a candid atmosphere of mutual respect, the two heads of state had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on strategic and overarching issues critical to the direction of China-U.S. relations and on major issues affecting world peace and development.

President Xi Jinping pointed out profoundly that for China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option. It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other. And conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides. For China and the United States, whether to enhance solidarity and cooperation or to provoke rivalry and confrontation will decide the future of humanity and Planet Earth. The United States must carefully think about the fundamental question of whether China and the United States are partners or rivals, and make the right historical choice. President Xi Jinping pointed out that through the summit in San Francisco, the two sides should assume a new vision. First, jointly developing a right perception. China hopes that the two countries could be partners that respect each other and coexist in peace. Second, jointly managing disagreements effectively. It is important that the two sides appreciate each other's principles and red lines, and refrain from flip-flopping, being provocative, and crossing the lines. They should have more communications, more dialogues and more consultations, and calmly handle their differences as well as accidents. Third, jointly advancing mutually beneficial cooperation. It is important to fully utilize the restored and new mechanisms in foreign policy, economy, finance, commerce, agriculture and other fields, and carry out cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, judicial and law enforcement affairs, artificial intelligence, and science and technology. Fourth, jointly shouldering responsibilities as major countries. China and the United States should step up coordination and cooperation on international and regional issues, and provide more public goods for the world. The two sides should coordinate and connect their initiatives. Fifth, jointly promoting people-to-people exchanges. The two sides should encourage and support greater interactions and communication between their people. The five points constitute the five pillars of China-U.S. relations and open up a future-oriented San Francisco vision.

President Xi Jinping also mainly elaborated on China's serious position on the Taiwan question and issues of science and technology, and economy and trade, and emphasized that the U.S. side should take real actions to honor its commitment of not supporting ""Taiwan independence"", stop arming Taiwan, and support China's peaceful reunification. President Xi Jinping firmly pointed out that stifling China's technological progress is nothing but a move to deprive the Chinese people of their right to development. China will not tolerate that, and hopes that the U.S. side take China's concerns seriously and lift its unilateral sanctions so as to provide a fair and nondiscriminatory environment for Chinese businesses.

President Joe Biden reaffirmed the five commitments he made in Bali, i.e., the United States does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China's system, does not seek to revitalize its alliances against China, does not support ""Taiwan independence"", and has no intention to have a conflict with China. President Joe Biden said that conflict between the United States and China is not inevitable. A stable and growing China is good for the United States and the whole world. The United States is glad to see prosperity in China. It does not seek to contain or suppress China's development or to decouple with China.

Through concerted efforts of the two sides, more than 20 important outcomes were yielded at the summit, including the establishment of inter-governmental dialogue on artificial intelligence in response to the expectations of the international community, the establishment of a working group on counternarcotics cooperation between China and the United States on the premise of removing sanctions against China's relevant agencies, the resumption of high-level communication and institutional dialogue between the two militaries on the basis of equality and respect, the agreement to increase much more direct flights earlier next year, the expansion of exchanges in education, culture, sports and business communities and among overseas students and the youths, the welcome to operationalize the Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s between China and the United States, and the joint promotion of the success of the 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Dubai. In particular, the two heads of state recognized the efforts made by and the consensus reached between the teams of the two countries to discuss the guiding principles of China-U.S. relations since the Bali summit, and emphasized that the two sides should respect each other, coexist in peace, maintain communication, prevent conflicts, abide by the United Nations Charter, carry out cooperation in fields involving common interests, and manage and control competitive factors in bilateral relations in a responsible manner, providing guidance for promoting China-U.S. relations back onto the right track.

The international public closely followed and spoke highly of the summit, and widely believed that the face-to-face communication between the heads of state is of paramount importance and has an irreplaceable role in stabilizing China-U.S. relations. This summit has demonstrated the two sides' positive will, yielded important outcomes, and was of extraordinary significance. It has played a key role in guiding China-U.S. relations undergoing ups and downs. President Joe Biden also said in his five subsequent Twitter posts that it is the most positive summit with the most important outcomes.

Wang Yi said that the China-U.S. summit meeting in San Francisco stands as a major event in the history of China-U.S. relations and international relations, and is conducive to advancing China-U.S. relations in the direction of sound, stable and sustainable development. President Xi Jinping has guided the giant ship of China-U.S. relations from Bali to San Francisco by navigating hidden rocks and dangerous shoals, which demonstrated his political mission and strategic charisma as the leader of a major country. Meanwhile, the two sides should be soberly aware that China-U.S. relations have never been smooth sailing. There are still many deep-seated and structural problems, and many risks and challenges that need to be addressed jointly. San Francisco should not be the finish line but a new starting point. The key to consolidating the sound momentum of China-U.S. relations is that the United States should honor its promise, meet China halfway, and take real actions to act upon the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state. Next year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. The two sides should build on the achievements made at the summit in San Francisco to promote the continuous improvement and development of China-U.S. relations, which is in alignment with the interests and wishes of the people of the two countries and the expectations of the world.

II. Galvanizing our peoples into a strong force

Wang Yi said, President Xi Jinping delivered a speech to the American people in Seattle in 2015, which brought the hearts of the two peoples closer with plain words and vivid stories. The warm scene at that time is still vivid in his mind. In recent years, the political atmosphere of China-U.S. relations has undergone complex changes, and the COVID-19 pandemic has also hindered normal exchanges between the two peoples. Since the beginning of this year, new and old American political figures, business leaders, and people from civil society have visited China in succession. President Xi Jinping has met with or sent letters to friendly individuals from the United States on multiple occasions and actively interacted with them. When President Xi Jinping recently met with Governor of the State of California Gavin Newsom, he pointed out that the hope of the China-U.S. relationship lies in the people, its foundation is in the two societies, its future depends on the youth, and its vitality comes from exchanges at subnational levels. These four sentences are profound and enlightening, expressing the common aspirations of people from all walks of life in the two countries.

During the visit, President Xi Jinping, upon invitation, attended the welcome dinner jointly hosted by friendly organizations in the United States. Heads from all walks of life in the United States and important business leaders were present. The old owner of the house where President Xi Jinping stayed during his first visit to the United States, other friends from Iowa who have extended their friendship for 40 years, a 103-year-old veteran member of the Flying Tigers, descendants of General Joseph W. Stilwell, and representatives of friendly people from Kuliang and Washington State, among others, also came to San Francisco for the meeting. President Xi Jinping had a cordial meeting with them, recalling the past and expressing gratitude for their commitment to the original aspiration of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. The scene was very warm and touching.

President Xi Jinping delivered an important speech, mentioning the word ""people"" more than 60 times. He stressed that the foundation of China-U.S. relations was laid by the two peoples; the door of China-U.S. relations was opened by the two peoples; the stories of China-U.S. relations are written by the two peoples; the future of China-U.S. relations will be created by the two peoples. Although the two countries are different in history, culture and social system and have embarked on different development paths, the two peoples are both kind, friendly, hardworking and down-to-earth. It is the reaching out to each other by the two peoples that has time and again brought China-U.S. relations from a low ebb back onto the right track. Once opened, the door of China-U.S. relations cannot be shut again. The more difficulties there are, the greater the need for the two countries to forge a closer bond between the two peoples and to open their hearts to each other, and more people need to speak up for the relationship. President Xi Jinping's sincere words and vivid stories deeply touched the audience and aroused strong resonance. More than 400 guests stood up twice and responded with nearly 20 prolonged and warm applause. They all said that the United States and China are interdependent. The profound friendship between the two peoples is the source of vitality for the long-term and steady growth of U.S.-China relations. As two important major countries in the world, maintaining dialogue and cooperation between the United States and China is crucial for both countries and the world. They expressed that they will continue their commitment to promoting mutual understanding between the two peoples and contributing to the improvement and development of U.S.-China relations.

Wang Yi said, ""From Seattle to San Francisco, after 8 years, President Xi Jinping once again had cordial interactions with friendly people from all walks of life in the United States, which made us deeply feel that the foundation of China-U.S. friendship is still there, the motivation for exchanges remains, and the prospect for cooperation is promising."" No matter how the global landscape evolves, the ultimate wish of the two peoples for exchanges and cooperation will not change. The bright future of China-U.S. relations will depend on the people. President Xi Jinping's important speech will surely inspire the people of both countries to participate more actively in the cause of China-U.S. friendship and accumulate more positive energy for the stable and sound development of China-U.S. relations. This visit also reflects that valuing goodwill and friendship is a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation and a warm defining feature of China's diplomacy. President Xi Jinping not only focuses on enhancing his friendship with leaders, but also makes friends from all walks of life, giving major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics a style of friendship, justice, sincerity, affinity and harmony.

III. Carrying forward the original aspiration of Asia-Pacific cooperation

Wang Yi said, APEC is the highest-level, broadest and most influential economic cooperation platform in the Asia-Pacific region. Thirty years ago, the APEC Leaders' Meeting mechanism was launched in Seattle, the United States, turning the region into a powerhouse for world economic growth and an anchor of stability for global development. Thirty years later, President Xi Jinping renewed the original aspiration of the APEC mechanism on the west coast of the United States, and once again charted the course and drew a blueprint for Asia-Pacific cooperation.

President Xi Jinping profoundly summarized the useful inspiration from Asia-Pacific cooperation, pointing out that openness and inclusiveness is the defining feature of Asia-Pacific cooperation, development for all is the overarching goal of Asia-Pacific cooperation, and seeking common ground while shelving differences is the best practice in Asia-Pacific cooperation. Focusing on what we should do to usher in another ""golden 30 years"" for the Asia-Pacific, President Xi Jinping, with his grand historical vision, put forward proposals and solutions based on the analysis of problems. He proposed to stay committed to innovation-driven development, openness in development, green development, and inclusive development that delivers benefits to all, and promote the building of an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future through high-quality development so that the fruits of modernization are shared by people across the world. These four aspects are consistent with China's new development philosophy and are things that China is doing down to earth, showing that China is committed to better empowering the development of the Asia-Pacific with its own actions and joining hands with all parties to promote high-quality growth in the Asia-Pacific. In response to certain countries' blatant calls for division and confrontation and malicious suppression of other countries' development, President Xi Jinping pointed out sharply that development is the eternal theme of the Asia-Pacific region. Development is only possible with cooperation, the absence of cooperation is the biggest risk, and decoupling and supply-chain disruption are not in anyone's interests. The region cannot and should not be an arena for geopolitical rivalry, still less should it be plunged into a new cold war or camp-based confrontation.

The series of major initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are in keeping with the overriding trend and people's aspiration. They have important guiding significance and practical value for Asia-Pacific cooperation and global development, and have been highly recognized by and received positive responses from all parties present at the meeting. The Leaders' Declaration adopted at the meeting fully reflects China's ideas and propositions such as the implementation of the Putrajaya Vision, the building of an Asia-Pacific community, the development of the Asia-Pacific Free Trade Area, inclusive and sustainable development, and connectivity. The international commentary describes that at the critical juncture of the 30th anniversary of the first APEC Leaders' Meeting, it is clear to the world which countries adhere to the original aspiration of Asia-Pacific cooperation, stay open and inclusive, and pursue mutual benefit and win-win results, and which countries go against the original aspiration and engage in geopolitical confrontation and decoupling and supply-chain disruption. No matter how the international situation changes, China will follow the trend of history, continue to promote an open economy and Asia-Pacific economic integration, and be committed to realizing the Asia-Pacific dream of common development, prosperity and progress.

IV. Expounding on China's path and vision

Wang Yi said, against the backdrop of sluggish world economic recovery and increasing uncertainties, the world is paying close attention to China's performance as a major global economy, with widespread expectations for China to continue playing the role as a ""power source"" and ""stabilizer"" for global growth. During the visit, President Xi Jinping delivered a written speech at the APEC CEO Summit, and made a comprehensive and in-depth introduction to the essence of Chinese modernization and its global significance to all walks of life in the United States and APEC participants on multiple occasions.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that Chinese modernization is socialist modernization pursued under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). It contains elements that are common to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the Chinese context. President Xi Jinping stressed that China is committed to striving in unity to achieve modernization for more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. China is committed to prosperity for all to deliver a better life for each and every Chinese. China is committed to well-rounded development to achieve both material and cultural-ethical advancement for the people. China is committed to sustainable development to achieve harmony between man and nature. China is committed to peaceful development to build a community with a shared future for mankind. These five ""commitments"" expound on the main characteristics of Chinese modernization in plain and accessible language, making the world further understand the mission and tasks of the CPC and China's development path.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that China's economy has been steadily recovering and turning for the better. Its growth rate is among the highest among major economies of the world. China remains the most powerful engine of global growth, and will generate one-third of global growth this year, sending the strongest message of promising prospects for China's economy. President Xi Jinping emphasized that China enjoys distinct strengths such as a socialist market economy in systemic terms, a supersize market in terms of demand, a full-fledged industrial system in terms of supply, and abundant, high-caliber labor forces and entrepreneurs in terms of human resources. President Xi Jinping made an authoritative statement on the internal logic and strong resilience of China's economic growth. Using vivid examples, President Xi Jinping illustrated China's unswerving resolve to promote high-quality development and high-standard opening up. Both the unprecedented successes of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and the recent sixth China International Import Expo depict a dynamic picture that China pursues development with its doors open, and it is pursuing high-quality development and high value-added and green economic growth. President Xi Jinping stressed that no matter how the international situation evolves, China's resolve to foster a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment will not change. And its policy of providing equal and quality services to foreign investors will not change. President Xi Jinping announced that China will hold the second Global Digital Trade Expo, and also announced that China will further shorten the negative list on foreign investment, fully ensure national treatment for foreign investors, and promote the free and orderly flow of data in compliance with the law. President Xi Jinping's ""two unchanged"" statement and a series of major policy announcements were sonorous and powerful, sending a strong signal of China's high-standard opening up to the outside world and boosting the confidence of all parties in continuing cooperation with China. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo and business leaders stated that the United States welcomes a stable and prosperous China. Economic and trade cooperation with China has created a large number of jobs for the United States and American companies have a strong interest in the Chinese market. The United States is committed to developing long-term and stable relations with China.

During the visit, President Xi Jinping also had friendly bilateral meetings with President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President of Peru Dina Ercilia Boluarte Zegarra, Prime Minister of Fiji Sitiveni Rabuka, and Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei Darussalam, providing strategic guidance for future development of relations. President Xi Jinping also met with Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio at the latter's request. The two leaders reaffirmed the two countries' commitment to abiding by the principles and common understandings of the four China-Japan political documents, and reconfirmed the positioning of comprehensively promoting a strategic relationship of mutual benefit and the commitment to building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship fit for the new era. These bilateral meetings, together with the China-U.S. summit meeting and President Xi Jinping's attendance at APEC meetings, have made important efforts to create a favorable external environment for domestic high-quality development.

Wang Yi concluded that this visit is another successful practice of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, and a ""big move"" by President Xi Jinping in managing relations between major countries. From the meeting between the heads of state of China and Russia held in Moscow at the beginning of this year to the China-U.S. summit meeting held in San Francisco at the end of this year, China has unremittingly advanced coordination and cooperation among major countries and facilitated the building of a framework of major-country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development, fully demonstrating China's responsibility as a major country. This visit is also President Xi Jinping's ""final stop"" to the multilateral summits he attended this year. From the first China-Central Asia Summit to the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, and from the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg to the APEC Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco, China's propositions and visions have gained more popularity, and China's constructive role as a major country has become more prominent. This visit once again proves that no matter how the international situation changes, President Xi Jinping always guides China's diplomacy to meet challenges head on and move forward courageously with his farsighted vision, strong determination and outstanding wisdom, creating a proactive and favorable environment for realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and making more and greater contributions to the world peace, development and progress. Wang Yi said, ""The east wind blows and the rain falls on the green hills. We must further study and gain a thorough understanding of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, and under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and with the guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, we must continue to break new ground in major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.""",China
161123,Wang Yi Gives a Readout on How the China-U.S. Summit Meeting in San Francisco will Impact China-U.S. Relations,"On November 15, 2023 local time, President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden held a summit meeting at the Filoli Estate in San Francisco, the United States. After the meeting concluded, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave a readout on how the meeting will impact the current and future China-U.S. relations to the press upon request.

Wang Yi said, the San Francisco meeting is significant for enhancing trust, removing suspicion, managing differences and expanding cooperation between China and the United States. It is also significant for injecting certainty and stability into a world of turbulence and transformation. Under the stewardship of the two presidents, the giant ship of China-U.S. relations has navigated hidden rocks and dangerous shoals. The journey from Bali to San Francisco has not been an easy one. However, San Francisco should not be the finish line; it should be a new starting point. We always believe that China and the United States eventually should and can find the right way to get along. This is a historical inevitability, the trend of our times and the expectation of the people. Next year will mark the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the United States. From San Francisco onward, the two sides should foster a new vision, further consolidate the foundation of their relations, build pillars for peaceful coexistence, and move their relationship in the direction of healthy, stable and sustainable development.",China
161123,Wang Yi Gives a Readout on How China Views the Disagreements between China and the United States,"On November 15, 2023 local time, President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden held a summit meeting in San Francisco, the United States. After the meeting concluded, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave a readout and answered questions from the press.

When asked by a journalist whether the two sides discussed disagreements and sensitive issues and China's position and attitude on them, Wang Yi said President Xi Jinping emphasized that China is committed to having a stable, healthy and sustainable relationship with the United States. At the same time, China has legitimate interests that must be safeguarded, principles and positions that must be upheld, and red lines that must not be crossed. If the U.S. side is bent on encircling and containing China under the pretext of competition, China will firmly uphold its sovereignty, security and development interests.

The Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. President Xi Jinping elaborated on China's principled position on the issue. China urges the U.S. to honor the one-China principle, oppose ""Taiwan independence"", stop arming Taiwan, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and support China's peaceful reunification.

President Xi Jinping also made clear China's position on issues related to economy, trade, and technology. He pointed out that attempts to curb or suppress China on economy, trade and technology are creating risks instead of ""de-risking"". These misguided actions, and the ensuing uncertainty for China-U.S. relations, have become the biggest risk. Stifling China's technological progress is nothing but a move to curb China's high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people of their right to development. China will not accept that and such a move will not succeed. China's development and growing strength, powered by strong internal drivers and its own inherent logic, will not be stopped by external forces. It is important that the U.S. side take China's concerns seriously, lift unilateral sanctions, and provide an equal, fair, and nondiscriminatory environment for Chinese businesses.",China
161123,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. President Joe Biden,"On November 15 local time, President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden held a summit meeting at the Filoli Estate, San Francisco. The two heads of state had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on strategic and overarching issues critical to the direction of China-U.S. relations and on major issues affecting world peace and development.

President Xi Jinping was warmly received by President Joe Biden upon arrival at the Filoli Estate.

President Xi Jinping noted that China and the United States are faced with two options in the era of global transformations unseen in a century: One is to enhance solidarity and cooperation and join hands to meet global challenges and promote global security and prosperity; and the other is to cling to the zero-sum mentality, provoke rivalry and confrontation, and drive the world toward turmoil and division. The two choices point to two different directions that will decide the future of humanity and Planet Earth. The China-U.S. relationship, which is the most important bilateral relationship in the world, should be perceived and envisioned in this broad context. For China and the United States, turning their back on each other is not an option. It is unrealistic for one side to remodel the other. And conflict and confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides. Major-country competition cannot solve the problems facing China and the United States or the world. The world is big enough to accommodate both countries, and one country’s success is an opportunity for the other.

President Xi Jinping elaborated on the essential features of Chinese modernization and its significance, China’s development prospects, and its strategic intention. He pointed out that China’s development is driven by its inherent logic and dynamics. China is promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through Chinese modernization. It will not take the old path of colonization and plundering, or the wrong path of seeking hegemony with growing strength. It does not export its ideology. It has no plan to surpass or unseat the United States. Likewise, the United States should not scheme to suppress and contain China.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation are the lessons learned from 50 years of China-U.S. relations as well as the conflicts between major countries in history. China and the United States should put in a lot of efforts to follow them. In San Francisco, the two sides should assume a new vision and build together five pillars for China-U.S. relations.

First, jointly developing a right perception. China is consistently committed to having a stable, healthy and sustainable relationship with the United States. At the same time, China has interests that must be safeguarded, principles that must be upheld, and red lines that must not be crossed. We hope that the two countries could be partners that respect each other and coexist in peace.

Second, jointly managing disagreements effectively. Disagreements should not be a chasm that keeps the two countries apart. Instead, the two sides should look for ways to build bridges to help them walk toward each other. It is important that they appreciate each other’s principles and red lines, and refrain from flip-flopping, being provocative, and crossing the lines. They should have more communications, more dialogues and more consultations, and calmly handle their differences as well as accidents.

Third, jointly advancing mutually beneficial cooperation. China and the United States have broad common interests in a wide range of areas, including traditional areas such as the economy, trade and agriculture, as well as emerging areas such as climate change and artificial intelligence (AI). Under current circumstances, the common interests between China and the United States have increased, not decreased. It is important to fully utilize the restored and new mechanisms in foreign policy, economy, finance, commerce, agriculture and other fields, and carry out cooperation in such areas as counternarcotics, judicial and law enforcement affairs, AI, and science and technology.

Fourth, jointly shouldering responsibilities as major countries. The problems facing human society cannot be solved without cooperation between major countries. China and the United States should lead by example, step up coordination and cooperation on international and regional issues, and provide more public goods for the world. The two sides should keep their initiatives open to each other or coordinate and connect them for synergy to the benefit of the world.

Fifth, jointly promoting people-to-people exchanges. The two sides should increase scheduled flights, advance tourism cooperation, expand subnational exchanges, strengthen cooperation in education and disability affairs, reduce negative factors hindering people-to-people exchanges, and encourage and support greater interactions and communication between their peoples, to cement the foundation for the healthy development of China-U.S. relations.



President Xi Jinping elaborated on China’s principled position on the Taiwan question. He pointed out that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. China takes seriously the positive statements made by the United States in the Bali meeting. The U.S. side should take real actions to honor its commitment of not supporting “Taiwan independence”, stop arming Taiwan, and support China’s peaceful reunification. China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that U.S. actions against China regarding export control, investment screening and unilateral sanctions seriously hurt China’s legitimate interests. Development of China is innovation-driven. Stifling China’s technological progress is nothing but a move to contain China’s high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people of their right to development. China’s development and growth, driven by its own inherent logic, will not be stopped by external forces. It is important that the U.S. side take China’s concerns seriously and adopt tangible steps to lift its unilateral sanctions so as to provide an equal, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for Chinese businesses.

President Joe Biden extended a warm welcome to President Xi Jinping to the United States for the meeting upon invitation. He said that he and President Xi Jinping had an important meeting a year ago in Bali. San Francisco is the gateway for Chinese immigrants to the United States, the place where the United States and China signed the U.N. Charter, and the first to establish a sister city relationship with China. It is fitting that the two presidents have another face-to-face meeting in San Francisco. He said he looked forward to a productive meeting, building on the basis set in Bali.

President Biden noted that he has always believed that the U.S.-China relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. Conflict between the two countries is not inevitable. A stable and growing China is good for the United States and the whole world. When the Chinese economy grows, it benefits the United States and the world. When the United States and China keep their relations stable, prevent conflict, manage differences, and cooperate in areas of shared interest, they will be better able to handle the issues facing themselves and common challenges. He reaffirmed the five commitments he made in Bali, i.e., the United States does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China’s system, does not seek to revitalize its alliances against China, does not support “Taiwan independence”, and has no intention to have a conflict with China. The two economies are mutually dependent. The United States is glad to see prosperity in China. It does not seek to contain or suppress China’s development or to decouple with China. The United States adheres to the one-China policy, welcomes dialogue between government agencies at various levels, and is ready to maintain open and candid communication with China to increase understanding, avoid misperceptions and manage differences. The United States is ready to keep growing economic and trade relations and strengthen cooperation with China in such important areas as fighting climate change, counternarcotics and AI. The U.S. side is glad to see more direct flights and more educational, scientific and technological and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.

The two presidents acknowledged the efforts of their respective teams to discuss the development of principles related to China-U.S. relations since the meeting in Bali. They stressed the importance of all countries treating each other with respect and finding a way to live alongside each other peacefully, and of maintaining open lines of communication, preventing conflict, upholding the U.N. Charter, cooperating in areas of shared interest, and responsibly managing competitive aspects of the relationship. The leaders welcomed continued discussions in this regard.

The two presidents agreed to promote and strengthen dialogue and cooperation between the two countries in various areas including China-U.S. government talks on AI and the establishment of a working group on counternarcotics cooperation. They agreed to resume on the basis of equality and respect high-level military-to-military communication, the China-U.S. Defense Policy Coordination Talks, and the China-U.S. Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings, and to conduct telephone conversations between theater commanders. They also agreed to commit to work toward a significant further increase in scheduled passenger flights early next year; and expand educational, student, youth, cultural, sports and business exchanges.

The two leaders underscored the importance of working together to accelerate efforts to tackle the climate crisis in this critical decade. They welcomed recent positive discussions between their respective special envoys for climate, including on national actions to reduce emissions in the 2020s and on common approaches toward a successful COP28 and on operationalization of the Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s to accelerate concrete climate actions.

Following the meeting, President Joe Biden hosted a luncheon in honor of President Xi Jinping. The two heads of state exchanged views on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and other international and regional issues of mutual concern.



President Joe Biden invited President Xi Jinping for a walk in the Filoli Estate, and he escorted President Xi to his limousine to bid farewell.

The meeting was positive, comprehensive and constructive. It has charted the course for improving and developing China-U.S. relations. And San Francisco should be a new starting point for stabilizing China-U.S. relations. They instructed their teams to build on the understandings reached in Bali and to timely follow up on and implement the new vision agreed on at San Francisco. The two heads of state agreed to continue their regular contact.

On this basis, both sides are to remove interference, overcome obstacles, and work together for a San Francisco meeting between the two heads of state.

Noting that with continuously improving business environment and increasingly rising degree of innovation, Wang Yi said that China is opening wider to the rest of the world. A series of major steps declared by President Xi Jinping at the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation have brought important benefits to promoting international cooperation and strengthening China-U.S. economic and trade exchanges. China appreciates the U.S. business community for overcoming the difficulties of the ups and downs in China-U.S. relations and remaining steadfast in advancing the China-U.S. friendship. The driving force for mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States remains strong, the foundation remains solid, and the space remains broad. Wang Yi expressed the hope that the U.S. business community will seize the new opportunities from China's high-quality development and high-standard opening up, give full play to the role of economic and trade cooperation as the ""ballast"", foster public support and social foundation for friendly relations between the two countries, and make new contributions to the improvement and development of China-U.S. relations.

The participating representatives said that the gradual resumption of dialogue and exchanges at all levels between the U.S. and China is encouraging. The interests of the two sides are closely integrated and a strong U.S.-China relationship is crucial to the success of both countries. The U.S. business community attaches great importance to China's transition to high-quality development, has full confidence in the Chinese market, and supports the two governments in taking effective measures to facilitate personnel exchanges. They anticipated the expansion of cooperation on economy and trade, science and technology, innovation and climate change response, so as to bring more benefits to the people of both countries.

","On October 12, 2023, Vice President Han Zheng met in Beijing with the U.S. representatives attending the fifth meeting of the China-U.S. Eminent Persons Forum.

Han Zheng said that as the world's two largest economies, China and the United States share far more common interests than differences and need to strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation in economy and trade, science and technology, and climate response. China has always viewed and handled its relations with the United States in accordance with the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forth by President Xi Jinping. Under the current circumstances, it is of particular importance for China and the United States to strengthen communication and dialogue at all levels, which is conducive to enhancing understanding and mutual trust, building consensus, properly managing differences, and creating sound conditions for practical cooperation in various fields.

091023,President Xi Jinping Meets with Delegation of U.S. Senate Led by Majority Leader Charles Schumer,"On the afternoon of October 9, President Xi Jinping met with the bipartisan delegation of the U.S. Senate led by Majority Leader Charles Schumer at the Great Hall of the People.

President Xi underlined that the China-U.S. relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. How China and the U.S. get along will determine the future of humanity. Competition and confrontation is not consistent with the trend of the times. Still less can it fix one’s own problems and address the challenges facing the world. China maintains that the common interests of the two countries far outweigh their differences, and the respective success of China and the U.S. is an opportunity, rather than a challenge, to each other. The “Thucydides Trap” is not inevitable, and Planet Earth is vast enough to accommodate the respective development and common prosperity of China and the U.S. Given the high degree of integration between the Chinese and U.S. economies and their closely entwined interests, both countries stand to benefit from each other’s development. A post-pandemic global recovery, meeting the climate challenge and resolving international and regional hotspots all require China-U.S. coordination and cooperation. As two major countries, China and the U.S. should demonstrate the broadmindedness, vision and readiness to rise to the occasion expected by the international community, and act with a sense of responsibility to history, to the people and to the world. The two countries should properly handle their relations, respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation. They should work to increase the well-being of the two peoples, and contribute to human progress and world peace and development. 

President Xi pointed out that the Chinese civilization has been developing uninterrupted for more than 5,000 years. It has all along striven to stay abreast with the times, learned from others in the spirit of inclusiveness, and kept to a philosophy of peace that highlights cooperation and exchanges. China has achieved the twin miracles of rapid economic development and long-term social stability, ended absolute poverty once and for all, and built a moderately prosperous society in all respects. These achievements are possible because the country has found a development path that suits its national conditions, meets the people’s expectations and has the people’s support. China will keep to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and advance Chinese modernization on all fronts. It will stay committed to peaceful development and work with all countries across the world to build a community with a shared future for mankind. China welcomes the visits of more U.S. Congress members to gain a better understanding of China’s past, present and future. It is hoped that the two legislatures will have more interactions, dialogues and exchanges to increase mutual understanding and make a positive contribution to the stabilization and improvement of the China-U.S. relationship.

Senator Schumer and other members of the delegation expressed their delight to visit the beautiful country of China and their appreciation to the Chinese side for its hospitality. During the visit, they have felt the vigor and potential of China’s development. They shared their views and suggestions on relevant issues in China-U.S. relations, noting that a stable U.S.-China relationship is of vital importance not only to the two countries, but also to world peace and development. China’s development and prosperity is good for the American people. The U.S. side does not seek a conflict with China, nor does it seek to decouple. The U.S. is willing to enhance dialogue and communication with China in an open and candid manner based on mutual respect, responsibly manage the bilateral relationship, and stabilize and strengthen U.S.-China relations. The U.S. side looks forward to strengthening bilateral trade and investment cooperation with China, and increasing communication and cooperation on such issues as climate change, drug trafficking and regional conflicts.

Wang Yi said that the world needs a stable China-U.S. relationship. President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a successful meeting in Bali, Indonesia last November, and reached important common understandings. The two sides should earnestly implement these common understandings, jointly remove disturbances, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the track of sound development.



Wang Yi pointed out that China is committed to the path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization, actively engages in international cooperation on climate response, and works to promote the building of a clean and beautiful world with the goal of building a community with a shared future for mankind. China is ready to strengthen dialogue and communication with the United States, explore mutually beneficial cooperation, and jointly cope with climate change.

Premier Li stressed the need to practice multilateralism and uphold the goals and principles set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement. All parties should shoulder their due responsibilities and abide by the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in addressing climate change.

Han Zheng said that China and the United States are the top two largest economies in the world and China-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world. To promote the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations, the key is to follow through on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forward by President Xi Jinping.

210623,Director-General of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Yang Tao Briefs Chinese and Foreign Media on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's Visit to China,"On the evening of June 19, 2023, Director-General of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Yang Tao briefed Chinese and foreign media on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China and took questions.

Yang Tao said that President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden held a successful meeting in Bali last November, and reached a series of important common understandings, setting the direction for China-U.S. relations. The U.S. side expressed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s hope to visit China as early as possible to follow up on the meeting. China welcomed that. However, since the beginning of this year, China-U.S. relations have been firstly impacted by the unmanned airship incident, and then affected by Tsai Ing-wen's ""transit"" through the United States, and have been worsened by the U.S. repeated erroneous words and deeds that have undermined China's interests. These led to a serious deviation of China-U.S. relations from the track identified by the two heads of state, seriously interrupted the agenda of dialogue and cooperation between the two sides, and gravely damaged the hard-won momentum of improvement in bilateral relations.

For some time now, the U.S. has repeatedly expressed the hope to look forward, turn the page, and get back on track of the common understandings reached between the two heads of state at their Bali meeting, and stated several times that Secretary Blinken still hoped to pay a visit to China as soon as possible. The international community also expressed the universal hope that China and the U.S. could deescalate tension. A strained China-U.S. relationship is not in the interests of the people of the two countries, nor is it what the international community expects to see. At the request of the U.S. side, China and the U.S. have recently conducted a series of engagements and communication during which the Chinese side made clear its principled positions and major concerns, and asked the U.S. side to remove disturbances and create the right atmosphere and conditions for high-level interactions. Ultimately, as agreed between the two sides, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken paid a visit to China from June 18 to 19.

Yang Tao said that during Antony Blinken's visit to China, President Xi Jinping had a courtesy meeting with him on June 19. Xi expounded on China's principled position on stabilizing and growing China-U.S. relations from a strategic height, and shared his strategic thinking on how to guide the development of bilateral relations. President Xi Jinping emphasized the following points in the meeting: First, the world needs a generally stable China-U.S. relationship, and whether the two countries can find the right way to get along bears on the future and destiny of humanity. The vast expanse of the Earth is big enough to accommodate the respective development and common prosperity of China and the United States. Second, China respects U.S. interests and does not seek to challenge or displace the United States. In the same vein, the United States needs to respect China and must not hurt China's legitimate rights and interests. Neither side should try to shape the other side by its own will, still less deprive the other side of its legitimate right to development. Third, China hopes that the U.S. side will adopt a rational and pragmatic attitude, and work with China in the same direction. The two sides need to remain committed to the common understandings the two heads of state had reached in Bali, and translate the positive statements into actions so as to stabilize and improve China-U.S. relations.

On the same day, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met with Secretary Blinken, and made clear China’s positions on  China-U.S. relations, the Taiwan question, the technological suppression of China, and other major issues involving China's core concerns. On June 18, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang held talks with Secretary Blinken, and they had communication on a wide range of issues, including China-U.S. relations, the Taiwan question, and major international and regional issues of mutual interest and concern. Relevant meetings and talks were candid, in-depth, and constructive.

First, the Chinese side explicitly pointed out the crux of the current predicament in bilateral relations. The China-U.S. relationship is at the lowest point since its establishment. This does not serve the fundamental interests of the two peoples or meet the shared expectations of the international community. The root cause for this is U.S. misperception of China and its misguided China policy.

Second, the Chinese side pointed out that the United States need to reflect upon itself over the ups and downs in China-U.S. relations. The United States should adopt an objective and rational perception of China, work with China in the same direction, uphold the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, handle unexpected and sporadic events in a calm, professional and rational manner, jointly manage differences and avoid strategic surprises. It is necessary to deliver on the common understandings reached between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden in Bali in letter and spirit, and work to stabilize and steer the relations back to the right track.

Third, the Chinese side put forward the direction and path to go in stabilizing China-U.S. relations. China's policy toward the United States remains consistent and stable. China is committed to building a stable, predictable and constructive relationship with the United States. The two sides should act with a sense of responsibility for history, for the people and for the world to reverse the downward spiral of the relationship, bring it back to the track of sound and steady development, and jointly explore the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other in the new era. The most urgent task is to follow through on the common understandings reached between the two presidents in Bali with real actions, and the fundamental guidance lies in the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forward by President Xi Jinping. These principles should also be the spirit jointly upheld, the red line jointly defended, and the goal jointly pursued by both sides.

Fourth, the Chinese side explained the historical logic and inevitable trend of China's development and rejuvenation, elaborated on the distinctive features of Chinese modernization and the rich substance of China's whole-process people's democracy, and urged the U.S. side not to project onto China its assumption that a strong country is bound to seek hegemony and not to misjudge China based on the beaten path of traditional Western powers.

Fifth, the Chinese side reiterated China's red line on core interests and major concerns. The Chinese side expounded on its solemn position and raised clear demands on the Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, the issue of path and system, and technological suppression of China, among others. The Chinese side stressed that the Taiwan question is the core of China's core interests, the most consequential issue and the most pronounced risk in the China-U.S. relationship. The Chinese side urged the U.S. side to abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and unequivocally oppose ""Taiwan independence"". The Chinese side demanded that the United States stop playing up the so-called ""China threat"", lift illegal unilateral sanctions against China, stop suppressing China's scientific and technological advances, and not wantonly interfere in China's internal affairs.

Yang Tao briefed on the positive common understandings and results reached between the two sides. The most important one is that the two sides agreed to jointly implement the common understandings identified by the two presidents in Bali, and go back to the agenda set during the meeting. Both sides agreed to maintain high-level interactions according to the common understandings between the two presidents. Secretary Blinken invited State Councilor Qin Gang to visit the United States, and State Councilor Qin Gang expressed his readiness to make the visit at a mutually convenient time. Both sides agreed to keep moving forward consultations on the guiding principles of China-U.S. relations. Both sides agreed to continue advancing consultations through the joint working group to address specific issues in China-U.S. relations. Both sides agreed to encourage more people-to-people and educational exchanges and stay committed to increasing passenger flights between the two countries. Both sides welcomed more mutual visits by students, scholars and business people, and are ready to provide support and facilitation to this end.

Yang Tao answered questions from journalists.

Regarding the Taiwan question, Yang Tao said that the Taiwan question has always been the most crucial issue in China-U.S. relations. The United States has made clear commitments on ""one China"" by acknowledging that there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is a part of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. These commitments are explicitly reflected in the three China-U.S. joint communiqués. This also means that the United States recognizes the true status quo of the Taiwan Strait, that is, there is but one China in the world, and both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China, which the United States calls the ""one-China policy"". The U.S. ""one-China policy"" was originally straightforward, using only the three China-U.S. joint communiqués as the attributive words. But later the attributive words became more and more, and the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and ""Six Assurances to Taiwan"" were successively added. Both the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and the ""Six Assurances to Taiwan"" are unilaterally concocted by the U.S. side, not the consensus between China and the United States. China has resolutely opposed and refused to recognize them from the very beginning. There is also a move by the United States to link the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question with its ""one-China policy"" and make it a core element of its ""one-China policy"". This is not a reaffirmation of or adherence to the U.S. commitment to China, but a distortion of it.

Regarding the issues related to Xinjiang, Xizang and Hong Kong, Yang Tao said that the issues related to Xinjiang, Xizang and Hong Kong are not about human rights, religion or ethnicity. They are major issues concerning China's sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as China's national security, which bears on China's core interests and allows no external interference.

Regarding democracy and human rights, Yang Tao said that democracy and human rights are the common pursuits of mankind. We have full confidence in the progress of China's whole-process people's democracy and China's human rights cause, and hold that all countries have the right to follow the path of democracy and human rights that suits their national conditions. Countries have different practices in democracy and human rights, and they can learn from each other and improve together. However, they should not point fingers at other countries or even use democracy and human rights as a pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs.

Regarding the so-called ""rules-based international order"", Yang Tao said that the original intention of President Xi Jinping’s proposal to build a community with a shared future for mankind is to seek the largest possible common ground for building international solidarity and cooperation and meeting global challenges. China is the first country to put its signature on the UN Charter, and is a founder, defender and beneficiary of the current international order. Why should China change the existing international order? Some people keep talking about the ""rules-based international order"". But what are the rules they are referring to? If it is the UN Charter, China has no problem with it. If it is the rules formulated by a handful of countries, China, like many other countries, cannot accept it.

Regarding ""de-risking"", Yang Tao said that the first thing to clarify is what risks are and where they come from. China contributes stability, certainty, and positive energy to the world. How can it be a risk? No matter how it is disguised, the ""de-risking"" pushed by the U.S. means the same thing as ""decoupling and severing supply chains"". It is “desinicization” in essence, and will end up decoupling itself from opportunities, cooperation, stability, and development. Far from solving the U.S. own problems, this approach will backfire and hurt the U.S. itself, and encumber the world. What China and the United States should do is to work together to lead global cooperation in addressing global risks in the interests of the well-being of humanity.

Regarding communication, Yang Tao said that China never rejects communication. The crux of the matter is: How to communicate? Can it achieve desired results? Communication should be first and foremost based on mutual respect and equal-footed consultation. Communication must also be effective. One should not conduct communication just for the sake of communication, nor should one only seek to solve its own concerns while ignoring the other's concerns. One must not say one thing but do the opposite. China is ready to conduct constructive communication and dialogue in the spirit of mutual respect. The United States should also show its sincerity with concrete action. Stabilizing China-U.S. relations requires both sides to work together in the same direction.

Regarding China-U.S. military-to-military relations, Yang Tao said that the United States knows full well the reasons why China-U.S. military-to-military relations are encountering difficulties. That includes U.S. unilateral sanctions against China. The United States should first remove the obstacles to military exchanges and cooperation between the two sides.

Regarding the so-called treatment of U.S. enterprises in China, Yang Tao said that more than 70,000 U.S. enterprises are operating in China. According to the U.S.-China Business Council, nearly 90 percent of them are profitable, and most of them want to continue operations in China. China will open its door still wider, and will further foster a market-oriented, world-class business environment governed by a sound legal framework. In the meantime, both Chinese and foreign enterprises operating in China must abide by the law.

Regarding the South China Sea issue, Yang Tao said that the United States is not a party to the South China Sea dispute. China's position on the South China Sea issue is based on sufficient historical and legal grounds. There has never been any problem with the freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea. In fact, it is the U.S. warships and aircraft that have flexed muscles and provoked China in adjacent areas of China under the guise of ""freedom of navigation"", thus increasing the maritime and air security risks. If the United States truly cares about stability in the South China Sea and wants to avoid any accidents, it should stop close-in reconnaissance on China.

Regarding the Ukraine crisis, Yang Tao said that China's position is very clear and consistent. President Xi Jinping has put forward ""four points"" on what must be done, ""four things"" the international community must do together, and ""three observations"" on the crisis. These are the basic principles China follows in handling the Ukraine crisis, and the essential idea is to promote talks for peace and seek political settlement. China supports all efforts conducive to bringing an end to the hostilities and promoting peace talks. China will continue to uphold an objective and impartial position and work in its own way to promote peace talks. China will not favor one side against the other, nor will it add fuel to the fire, still less exploit the crisis to its own advantage. No country can force China to take sides, nor should they distort and smear China's position. Unilateral sanctions against Chinese enterprises and individuals must be stopped. Should China have to choose a side, it chooses to stand on the side of peace and the side of promoting peace talks and seeking political settlement. Some countries have demanded that China not provide weapons to Russia, but who on earth are providing weapons to the conflicting party? The world could not see it more clearly. China urges relevant countries to stop fanning the flames and fueling the fire, and stop smearing and slandering China.

210623,"Director-General of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Yang Tao Points out that the U.S. Side Making the Peaceful Resolution of Taiwan Question the Core Element of ""One-China Policy"" is a Distortion of Its Political Commitment","On the evening of June 19, 2023, Director-General of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Yang Tao briefed Chinese and foreign media on U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China.

In response to the United States linking the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question with its ""one-China policy"", Yang Tao said that the Taiwan question has always been one of utmost importance in China-U.S. relations. The United States has made clear commitments on ""one China"" by acknowledging that there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is a part of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China”. These commitments are explicitly reflected in the three China-U.S. joint communiqués. This also means that the United States recognizes the true status quo of the Taiwan Strait, that is, there is but one China in the world, and both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China, which the United States calls the ""one-China policy"". The U.S. ""one-China policy"" was originally straightforward, using only the three China-U.S. joint communiqués as the attributive words. But later the attributive words became more and more, and the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and ""Six Assurances to Taiwan"" were added. Both the ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and the ""Six Assurances to Taiwan"" are unilaterally concocted by the U.S. side, not the consensus between China and the United States. China has resolutely opposed and refused to recognize them from the very beginning. There is also a move by the United States to link the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question with its ""one-China policy"" and make it a core element of its ""one-China policy"". This is not a reaffirmation of or adherence to the U.S. political commitment to China, but a distortion of it.",China
190623,Wang Yi: Asia-Pacific Cooperation Should Return to the Right Direction,"On June 19, 2023, when meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi made clear China's position on the so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" pursued by the U.S.

Wang Yi stressed that the so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy"" is essentially about bringing major-country antagonism to and creating bloc confrontation in the Asia-Pacific region. He noted that the U.S. actions have changed the status quo of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, undermined the way by which the Asia-Pacific countries have got along and coexisted in harmony as neighbors, distorted the industrial and supply chains in the region, and weakened the ASEAN-centered regional cooperation architecture. Wang Yi pointed out that the United States has turned away from an open and inclusive regional policy, and is moving toward an exclusive and divisive one, which runs counter to the overarching trend toward continuous prosperity and development in the Asia-Pacific region.

Wang Yi said hosting this year's APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is an important opportunity for the U.S. to rethink and recalibrate its Asia-Pacific policy. China is ready to work with the United States to explore a way for sound interaction in the Asia-Pacific, and hopes that the U.S. will play its role as the host of APEC and work with China to enable Asia-Pacific cooperation to return to the right direction.",China
140623,Qin Gang Has a Phone Call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On June 14 Beijing time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang had a phone call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the latter's request.

Qin Gang pointed out that since the beginning of this year, China-US relations have encountered new difficulties and challenges, and it is very clear who is to blame. China has always viewed and handled China-US relations in accordance with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping.

Qin Gang made clear China's solemn position on the Taiwan question and China's other core concerns. He stressed that the United States should respect China’s concerns, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security, and development interests in the name of competition. He expressed the hope that the United States will take concrete actions to implement the important common understandings reached between the two heads of state at the Bali meeting and the relevant commitments made by the US, and work with China to effectively manage differences, promote exchanges and cooperation, stabilize the relationship from further deterioration, and bring it back to the track of sound and stable development.",China

Chinese modernization is the modernization of a huge population, common prosperity for all, and harmony between humanity and nature, and will create unprecedented growth potential and market demand, thus providing broad prospects for the development of China's new energy vehicle industry. China will continue to firmly advance high-standard opening up and remain committed to fostering a better market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment for Tesla and other enterprises of all countries. China's development is an opportunity for the world. A sound, steady and constructive China-US relationship will benefit both China and the United States and the larger world. Using Tesla's car as an analogy, Qin said that promoting sound China-US relations is like driving a car. Both sides need to hold the steering wheel and move the relations forward in the right direction of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as proposed by President Xi Jinping, “hit the brakes” in time to avoid ""dangerous driving"", and ""step on the gas"" at the right time to advance mutually beneficial cooperation.

Elon Musk said that with the hardworking and talented people, China's development makes perfect sense.

Qin Gang said that art is the common language of mankind. Berklee College of Music is a world-renowned institution for modern music education, and has been at the forefront of China-US art education cooperation for years. The artistic exchanges between China and the United States enjoy great potential. Qin Gang expressed the hope that Berklee College of Music will serve as a bridge for China-US artistic exchanges, a bond between Chinese and American youth, and a window for correct understanding between China and the US, and make greater contributions to deepening the people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States and promoting the understanding and friendship between the two peoples, especially the youth.

080523,Qin Gang Meets with US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns,"On May 8, 2023, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns in Beijing.

Qin Gang said that the China-US relationship is of great significance not only for both countries but also for the world. In November last year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a successful meeting in Bali and reached important common understandings. However, a series of erroneous words and deeds by the US side since then have undermined the hard-won positive momentum of the China-US relationship. The agenda of dialogue and cooperation agreed upon by the two sides has been disrupted, and the bilateral relationship has once again encountered a freeze. The pressing task is to stabilize the China-US relationship, avoid a spiral decline, and prevent any unexpected incidents between China and the US. This should be the most fundamental consensus between China and the US, as well as a bottom line that must be upheld in the interaction between countries, especially between two major countries. China will remain committed to handling the China-US relationship in line with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation put forward by President Xi Jinping. China hopes that the US will do some soul-searching and work with China in the same direction to bring the China-US relationship out of dilemmas and get back on the right track.

Qin Gang said that the US should correct its perception of China, and reinstate a rational policy toward China. Likening the China-US relationship as a shirt, Qin Gang stressed the need to fasten the first button correctly and contribute to each other’s success in the two countries' respective better development. The US should not talk about communication while continuously suppressing and containing China. The US must not say one thing but do the opposite. The US must respect China’s bottom lines and red lines, and stop damaging China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests. In particular, the US must handle the Taiwan question in the right way. It must stop hollowing out the one-China principle, and stop supporting and conniving at “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. In handling unexpected incidents in the bilateral relationship, a calm, professional, and pragmatic attitude must be adopted to avoid further impacts on the China-US relationship. The two countries should advance dialogue and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity. Harmony without uniformity, harmonious co-existence, and respective and collective prosperity are what the two countries should work together for their relationship and the world. Qin Gang expressed his hope that Ambassador Burns will conduct more engagements and exchanges and engage in thoughtful reflection in China, serve as a bridge between China and the US, and make constructive efforts.",China
130423,Qin Gang: The United States Should Draw Lessons from Its Failure in Afghanistan,"On April 13, 2023 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Qin Gang gave a briefing to the press after the Second Informal Meeting on Afghanistan Between Foreign Ministers of  China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran.

When asked for comment on the White House report on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan which acknowledged that the withdrawal was ""a huge intelligence failure"" and blamed the former administration for the chaotic troop withdrawal, Qin Gang said that the U.S. failure in Afghanistan is multifold. First, it was a military failure. The military subjugation did not bring a moment of peace to Afghanistan, and the 20 years of occupation by the U.S. military had been 20 years of conflicts and turmoil in Afghanistan. Second, it was a political failure. The ""democratic transformation"" carried out by the U.S. and other Western countries in Afghanistan failed to fit into local conditions, and the issue of national reconciliation in Afghanistan has dragged on unresolved to today. Third, it was a counter-terrorism failure. With the U.S. interference, the terrorism issue has got from bad to worse in Afghanistan. The number of Afghan terrorist groups has increased from single digits 20 years ago to more than 20 today, leaving a huge ""security black hole"".

Qin Gang emphasized that the troop withdrawal by the U.S. does not mean that it could shirk off its responsibility, nor does the investigation report mean that the U.S. can draw a line under its shameful acts in Afghanistan. The U.S. should not sit back and ignore the current plight of the Afghan people, and the Afghan people's hard-earned money forcibly seized by the U.S. must be returned as soon as possible. Qin expressed the hope that the U.S. will truly draw a lesson from what happened in Afghanistan, and changed its wrong course at an early date. The U.S. should not judge or interfere in other countries' systems based on Western standards, nor should it attempt to reset military forces in Afghanistan and the region, still less supporting and employing terrorism.",China

Conclusion

Introduction

The United States is a nation of immigrants. Ever since colonial times, immigrants from around the world have come to the country in waves. However, the history of U.S. treatment of immigrants is one rife with inhumane tragedies such as discrimination, exclusion, arrest, detention, expulsion, and a litany of human rights abuses. Worse still, the recent years have witnessed one humanitarian disaster after another caused by the U.S. government on refugees and immigrants going to the country.

This report gives a truthful account of the United States' egregious record on the issue of refugees and immigrants by reviewing events in the past and present within the United States and beyond. Using facts and figures, this report lays bare the lies and double standards on the issue of refugees and immigrants of the United States, a self-proclaimed ""beacon of democracy.""

I. Violations of the Rights of Immigrants in the United States

◆ When the United States was first founded, white Americans, mainly Anglo-Saxon Protestants, were very suspicious of immigrants and tried to restrict and assimilate them. A U.S. president once said outright that there is no need to encourage emigration ""except of useful mechanic's-and some particular descriptions of men-or professions."" Fearful of domestic chaos inspired by the French Revolution, in 1798, the U.S. government formulated the laws such as the Naturalization Act, the Alien Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. These acts made it more difficult for immigrants to become U.S. citizens and gave the president the power to imprison and deport dangerous immigrants or those from enemy countries. It is worth noting that the Alien Enemies Act is still in effect today.

◆Black people are among the earliest immigrants to the United States. Their immigration was not voluntary, but forced. After they arrived in the United States, they suffered inhuman abuses and had no human rights to speak of. In 1619, the first 20 Africans were sold as slaves to the colony of Virginia. Soon after that, the colonies passed laws to legitimate black slaves as ""permanent property"" whose children also automatically became slaves. The idea and the system of racism against blacks have thus taken root in America. In order to justify the enslavement of blacks, white people established an oppressive racial hierarchy based on skin color. The United States Declaration of Independence declared that ""all men are created equal."" Nonetheless, the earliest U.S. Constitution did not recognize the civil rights of blacks. The three-fifths clause was introduced, under which the actual number of black slaves would be multiplied by three-fifths in the allocation of House seats. The harms of historical enslavement still haunt black descendants today. Their rights to life, development and political participation are not effectively secured.

◆Irish immigrants were severely discriminated against and alienated in the early years of the United States. Between the 1830s and the 1860s, Catholic Irish immigrated to the United States in large numbers. A strong movement against Irish immigrants emerged. Irish immigrants were stigmatized and labeled as being lazy, inferior, violent and dangerous. A large number of early American nativist and exclusionist organizations and political parties were formed at this time. The American Party, or the Know-Nothing Party, made anti-Irish immigration its main agenda. In the 1850s, the party produced seven governors, eight senators and 104 House representatives. New York and Massachusetts enacted laws to deport and repatriate Irish immigrants. Xenophobes even resorted to violence, attacking Irish immigrants and burning down their churches. In 1844, riots against Irish immigrants broke out in Philadelphia, causing at least 20 deaths. Irish immigrants were treated as blacks and were not accepted by white Americans until the 20th century. They were long-time victims of racial discrimination in the United States.

◆The anti-Chinese movement is among the most infamous in discriminating and ostracizing immigrants in the U.S. history. Since the mid-19th century, Chinese laborers were trafficked in large numbers by Americans to the United States as coolies. By 1880, the total number had exceeded 100,000. The Chinese laborers undertook the most arduous work in the construction of the Central Pacific Transcontinental Railroad. Thousands of people died. They made enormous contributions to the development of the United States with their hard work and even their lives, but were not treated with respect and kindness which they deserved because of rampant racism in the United States. As the railroad projects came to completion, the United States began to turn its back on those who helped it. In 1875, the U.S. Congress passed the Page Act, obstructing the entry of Chinese laborers and women. In 1882, the United States went further and enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, putting an absolute end to immigration from China and denying resident Chinese immigrants U.S. citizenship. It was the first and only law in the United States to ban all members of a specific ethnic group from immigrating to the country on the grounds of race and nationality. It was not until 1943 that it was formally repealed. To prevent Chinese immigration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services established an immigration detention facility on San Francisco's Angel Island in 1910, which remained open until 1940. Meanwhile, Chinese immigrants suffered from severe violent attacks. On Oct. 24, 1871, 19 Chinese immigrants were killed by hundreds of white people around Calle de los Negros in Los Angeles. In 1877, the houses of Chinese residents in Calle de los Negros were burned down by white people. In 1876 and 1877, two riots erupted in which armed white racists attacked Chinatown in San Francisco. Then on Sept.2, 1885, white miners rioted on the Stone Springs mine in Wyoming, destroying the residential village of Chinese workers and killing at least 28 Chinese immigrants.

◆Japanese immigrants were discriminated against and ostracized in the United States. Although Japan had undergone Meiji Restoration and championed ""leaving Asia and entering Europe"" at the turn of the 20th century, Japanese immigrants still faced discrimination and exclusion in the United States because of their different skin color and distinctive culture. The U.S. West Coast saw a particularly strong anti-Japanese sentiment. San Francisco adopted a policy to ban Japanese schoolchildren from public schools. In 1907, the United States and Japan reached the so-called Gentlemen's Agreement, meaning the United States would limit the entry of Japanese immigrants, and Japan would voluntarily ban immigration to the United States. In 1913, the California state government enacted the Alien Land Law, barring Asian immigrants, including Japanese, from owning land. In 1917, the U.S. Congress enacted the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which barred most Asians from immigrating to the United States. After the adoption of the Immigration Act of 1924, the Japanese were completely banned from immigrating to the United States. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were forcibly moved by the U.S. government from the West Coast to internment camps further inland. They had to take ""loyalty questionnaires"" to completely remove their suspicion of being an enemy alien. It was not until 1988 that the U.S. government formally apologized.

◆White immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe were strongly ostracized in the United States. Immigrants from countries like Italy, Poland, Greece and Russia made up the majority of U.S. immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. In 1911, the U.S. Congress released the Dillingham Commission report, claiming that Eastern and Southern European immigrants had made limited contributions to the United States and degraded the unique American race, culture and system. To curb their immigration, the report recommended having immigrants take literacy tests and introduced a nationality-based quota scheme. Racists sought to use the theory of evolution for their argument that immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe belonged to an inferior non-white race, and would contaminate the race of Anglo-Saxon whites in the United States. Xenophobes launched the Americanization Movement to deprive Eastern and Southern European immigrants of their language and culture, forcing them to be fully Americanized. Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company, required migrant workers in his company to attend the so-called English Melting Pot School. White supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan recruited millions of members to terrorize and attack Eastern and Southern European immigrants across the country. The 1917 October Revolution in Russia triggered the first Red Scare in the United States. The U.S. government was convinced that communists were among Eastern and Southern European immigrants, and used this excuse to arrest and deport them in large numbers.

◆The fear of foreign immigrants eventually led to the adoption of a race-based quota system. Following the Chinese Exclusion Act, the U.S. government enacted a series of laws to restrict immigration, which culminated in the Immigration Act that the U.S. Congress passed in 1924. This Act stipulated that the annual number of immigrants from each country to the United States shall not exceed 2 percent of the number of foreign-born population of that nationality as recorded in the 1890 census. Since Americans was mainly made up of immigrants from Western and Northern Europe before 1890, the Act effectively banned Asian immigration and restricted immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe. Quotas for immigration from different countries were actually allocated based on skin color, race and religious beliefs. The primary goal was to ensure that the majority of Americans were Anglo-Saxon Protestants. It was not until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was passed that the restrictions based on ethnic origins were formally abolished, and that immigrants from different countries were granted a relatively equal right of entry.

◆Hispanic immigrants, especially Mexican immigrants, have been among the most rejected by the United States since the 1920s. Most of the immigrants arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol since its establishment in 1924 have been Mexicans. In 1929, the United States made illegal entry a felony in an attempt to stop Mexican immigration. During the Great Depression, tens of thousands of Mexicans were deported from the United States. After the passing of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, Mexico became the largest source of immigration to the country, with arrests and deportations of Mexican immigrants often accounting for 90 percent of the total. In the late 1970s, the number of Mexican immigrants arrested each year was close to 800,000, and then rose to 1.5 million by the late 1990s. The influx of Mexican immigrants once again stoked strong xenophobia within the United States. American political scientist Samuel Huntington points out in his book Who Are We that Mexican and Hispanic immigration ""could eventually change America into a country of two languages, two cultures, and two peoples."" Hispanic immigrants are often a target of white supremacists in the United States. In 2019, angry at the ongoing ""Hispanic invasion"" in Texas, a white supremacist man drove more than a thousand kilometers to El Paso in West Texas and shot 23 people dead at a Walmart store. It was the largest domestic terrorist attack against Latinos in modern American history.

◆After the 9/11 incident, Muslim immigrants became a key target of U.S. surveillance and exclusion. Shortly after 9/11, more than 1,200 people, mostly Arabs and Muslims, were arrested and detained by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies. Many were held for months without charges and denied access to lawyers and family. Most ended up deported for minor immigration violations. More than 80,000 adult males from 25 Muslim countries were required by the U.S. government to be fingerprinted and photographed, among whom 13,000 migrants went into deportation proceedings and 2,870 were detained. The USA Patriot Act, enacted after 9/11, greatly expanded government powers, allowing the U.S. government to arbitrarily surveil and deport foreign nationals suspected of being involved in terrorism, and Muslims have become the main target group. The 9/11 incident had a strong impact on American society and allowed Islamophobia to penetrate deep into American politics. In 2017, the U.S. government enacted a Muslim ban, requiring that citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen be barred from entering the U.S. for at least 90 days.

II. The Human Rights Violations Against Refugees and Immigrants in the United States See No Improvement

◆In the 21st century, successive U.S. administrations have increasingly restricted immigration and treated immigrants harshly and inhumanely, with arrests, detentions, deportations and repatriation of immigrants on a large scale every year. The U.S. government arrested 850,000 migrants in 2019 and more than 1.7 million in 2021, a record high since 1986. The number of immigrants detained has grown rapidly. In August 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) detained more than 203,000 illegal immigrants from Mexico. In fiscal year 2022, more than 2.3 million refugees and immigrants were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border. A record high of more than 430,000 immigrants were deported from the United States in 2013. The number still reached 360,000 in 2019. More than 100,000 have been repatriated each year. In large-scale arrests, detentions, deportations and repatriation, the human rights of immigrants are grossly violated, and humanitarian disasters occur frequently. In September 2021, more than 15,000 refugees from Haiti gathered in the Texas border town of Del Rio, waiting for a slim chance to enter the United States. The refugees were brutalized by U.S. border enforcement agencies, with patrols on horseback wielding horse whips, charging into the crowd, and driving them into the river. The CNN commented that the scene was reminiscent of the dark periods in American history when slave patrols were used to control black slaves. On 25 October 2021, the United Nations Human Rights Council condemned the systematic and large-scale deportations by the United States of Haitian refugees and immigrants without assessing their individual situations as a violation of international law.

◆ The migrant truck tragedy shows how rampant human smuggling and trafficking is in the United States. On 27 June 2022, a tractor-trailer packed with illegal immigrants was found on the outskirts of San Antonio, Texas. The truck came from Laredo, a border city in Texas 150 miles away from where the vehicle was found. Local human smugglers planned to transport illegal immigrants by truck via San Antonio to the U.S. hinterland. The truck, which was abandoned on the roadside due to mechanical failure, was found with no water or air conditioning in its compartment and nearly 100 people crammed in. Among them, 53 people died from the stifling heat as local temperatures peaked at 38 degrees Celsius. It was the nation's most serious migrant death case to date. Human trafficking and forced labor have been widespread in the United States due to long-standing ineffective law enforcement and lack of justice. Recent years have seen thousands of human smuggling and trafficking cases taking place annually and the frequent occurrences of similar migrant truck tragedies. In fiscal year 2021 alone, 557 illegal immigrants died along the southern border of the United States.

◆ After COVID-19 broke out, the U.S. government used COVID as an excuse for large-scale deportations of illegal immigrants. In 2020, the U.S. government invoked Title 42 of the United States Code to prohibit immigrants from entering under the pretext of stemming the spread of COVID. Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the practice lacks a public health rationale and could instead increase the likelihood of the epidemic spreading. Through this practice, the U.S. government has made over 1.8 million deportations, expelling at least 215,000 parents and children, of whom 16,000 are unaccompanied children. The immigrants who were not deported for the time being were sent to detention facilities and continued to be subjected to inhumane treatment.

◆ The United States has set up the world's largest immigration detention system. Currently, there are more than 200 detention facilities in its border states. In order to save costs, the U.S. government often hands construction and operation of the immigration detention camps over to private companies, making them de facto private prisons. The abysmal conditions in the camps make those detained highly susceptible to physical and psychological illness or death. In July 2019, after visiting border patrol stations on the U.S.-Mexico border, U.S. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she had witnessed that the women being detained were held without drinking water and that detention officers told them to drink out of the toilet. She said that border patrol stations treat migrants like animals, constituting systemic abuse. A total of 21 people died in U.S. immigration detention facilities in fiscal year 2020, CNN reported, more than doubling the death toll in fiscal year 2019 and the highest number since 2005. Up to 80 percent of the more than 1.7 million immigrants detained in the United States in fiscal year 2021 were held in private detention facilities, including 45,000 children. The El Paso Times reported on 25 June 2021 that private contractors had exacerbated the horrible chaos at the U.S. Fort Bliss shelter where nearly 5,000 children were held. In the shelter, about 1,500 children were jailed in a stockyard-like, jam-packed and terrible environment that resulted in severe physical and mental trauma.

◆ The U.S. immigration policy has caused a serious humanitarian disaster to immigrants. To stop illegal immigrants from entering the country, the U.S. government has implemented a ""zero tolerance"" policy since April 2018, forcibly separating illegal immigrants from their minor children and detaining them in deplorable conditions. Footage provided by U.S. CBP shows some children even being held in cages with only thin blankets on their bodies. On 18 June 2018, at a meeting of the Human Rights Council, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, called the practice of forcing parents to part with their children as ""government-sanctioned child abuse."" UN human rights officials also called on the United States, the only country in the world that had not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to join the Convention as soon as possible and to respect the rights of all children. Hundreds of thousands of people across the 50 states of the United States staged demonstrations with the theme ""Families Belong Together"" to protest against the ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy that has resulted in the separation of at least 2,300 children from their families.

◆The U.S. law enforcement agencies have never stopped abusing migrant children. In 2019, over a thousand children were still separated from their parents, and 20 percent of them were under the age of five. After COVID-19 struck, the U.S. government enforced the provisions in Title 42 of the U.S. Code, which exacerbated the humanitarian disaster arising from the separation of children and their parents. According to a CNN report on 23 April 2021, more than 5,000 unaccompanied children were in U.S. CBP custody, and many were kept for longer than the legal limit. Records show that among the 266,000 migrant children held in government custody in recent years, more than 25,000 have been detained for longer than 100 days, nearly 1,000 for more than a year and at least three for over five years. On 26 June 2019, The New York Times covered a visit by an inspection group consisting of lawyers, doctors and journalists to a detention center of a border station in Clint, Texas. They found that children there were held in prison-like conditions. Hundreds of children were locked in one cell with virtually no adult supervision. A member of the inspection group likened the conditions to ""torture facilities"". UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet was deeply shocked by the overcrowded U.S. detention facilities, the poor sanitation conditions and the lack of access to adequate healthcare or food, according to a UN website report on 8 July 2019. She stated that detaining migrant children may constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment that is prohibited under international law. According to a report on the website of The Guardian on 11 October 2021, between 2016 and 2021, U.S. border agents engaged in more than 160 cases of abuse of asylum seekers, including children. Leading law enforcement agencies, notably CBP and U.S. Border Patrol, were involved.

◆Even if illegal immigrants manage to escape from detention and deportation, it is difficult for them to be treated equally in American society and they tend to become victims of crimes. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that illegal immigrants enjoy the right to equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In reality, however, illegal immigrants often suffer from legal and institutional discrimination and hardly enjoy basic rights and benefits. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 abolished most forms of public relief for illegal immigrants and even banned their children born in the United States from being automatically granted citizenship and access to public benefits. Many illegal immigrants have fallen victim to human trafficking and forced labor in the United States. The Associated Press revealed on 10 December 2021 that for years, illegal immigrants smuggled into the United States ended up forced to toil on farms, cowing to threats of deportation and violence by overseers while they lived in dirty, cramped trailers with little food or clean water. Identification documents of the laborers were withheld, preventing them from leaving and seeking help. The U.S. Department of Justice website released an indictment on a human trafficking case on 22 November 2021. The document showed that dozens of workers were illegally imported from Mexico and Central America to farms in the State of Georgia. Trapped in illegal detention and forced labor in brutal conditions, the workers became victims of modern-day slavery. Promised high wages to work on farms, they were instead forced to dig onions with their bare hands, and got paid only 20 cents per filled bucket as men with guns kept them in check. At least two of them died, and another was raped repeatedly.

◆Today, the serious discrimination in American society against immigrants and their descendants remains. ""Asia Hate"" has been particularly prominent in recent years. According to a 2022 survey by Stop AAPI Hate, the organization had reported 11,467 hate incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) over the past two years. Only 49 percent of AAPIs felt safe going out and 65 percent worried about the safety of family members and elders. As many as 72 percent of AAPIs who experienced hate incidents named discrimination against them as their greatest source of stress, even ahead of their health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

III.Multiple Domestic Factors Behind the Entrenched Immigration and Refugee Problem in the United States

◆Deep-rooted racial discrimination in the United States is an important cause of its immigration problem. Racism is embedded in U.S. immigration policies and its attitude toward immigrants. A country founded with Anglo-Saxon Protestants as the mainstay, the United States continues to view the culture of this population group as the core of its national identity. Immigrants who are not Anglo-Saxon Protestants are often regarded as the inferior race. With the influx of Hispanic and Asian immigrants, the United States is increasingly diverse in ethnicity and culture. In recent years, immigrants accounted for 40 percent of U.S. population increase. With the white population seriously ageing, immigrants are expected to contribute even more to U.S. population growth. The demographic change has left many white people worried about their own status. Hence, they are giving stronger support to conservative political stances, regardless of their party affiliation. A poll indicated that 56 percent of American voters believed the United States remained a racist society, and 70 percent of black respondents believed that more than half of white Americans believe in white supremacy.

◆Political polarization in the United States is worsening its immigration problem. In recent decades, the immigration issue has become more entangled with economic, racial and ideological issues as well as cultural values. The Democratic Party and the Republican Party have kept attacking each other, and a compromise is hard to reach. Democrats accuse Republicans of embracing nativism and white supremacy and inciting xenophobia and racial discrimination to win votes from the white population. Republicans accuse Democrats of accepting immigrants to gain more votes from ethnic minorities and more seats in the Congress. The partisan divide has prevented any significant immigration reform bill from passing Congress since the comprehensive Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Both Democrats and Republicans had put forth their own immigration reform proposals, but they all hit a dead end very soon.

◆Since the midterm election cycle began in 2022, both parties have used the refugee and immigrant issue as a political leverage. The administration pandered to voters and relaxed immigration control to some extent. With the ""American Dream"" rekindled, illegal immigrants flooded in across the borders. Some Republican governors transported refugees and illegal immigrants with buses and chartered planes from theirs to blue states and cities in an attempt to embarrass the federal government. In September 2022, Florida's Republican Governor flew 50 refugees from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Republican Governor of Texas bused over 100 Latin American refugees and immigrants right to the Vice President's doorstep. These immigrants were promised well-paid jobs before being transferred, only to find that still no proper settlement is available at their destination.

◆Conservative politicians and media in the United States are hyping up the immigrant threat and stoking anti-immigration sentiment. The far-right forces and conservative media have been disseminating a so-called ""great replacement"" theory, claiming that white Americans are being deliberately replaced by immigrants and ethnic minorities. This extreme idea has led to multiple terrorist attacks targeting immigrants and ethnic minorities in the country, the worst of which is the shooting incident in a shopping mall in El Paso. Since 2018, white supremacists have committed the most killings among violent extremist groups in the United States. In recent years, the Republicans have been playing up the immigrant threat in election campaigns, and drawn the attention from the conservatives to the immigration issue. They have rolled out many extreme anti-immigration measures, grossly violating the human rights of immigrants. For its part, the Democratic administration dare not to relax expulsion or detention of immigrants in fear of conservative opposition and in order to gain support from white voters, resulting in massive humanitarian disasters continuing in the United States. U.S. conservative politicians and media have also been depicting immigrants as grabbing jobs from low-skilled American workers, lowering wages, squeezing welfare resources, and increasing local government expenditure on education, healthcare and relief. They scapegoat immigrants for U.S. domestic problems, yet ignore their long-term, generally positive effect on the U.S. economy, such as supplying a large workforce, filling up low-level jobs that Americans won't take, and mitigating the impact of population ageing.

IV. The United States Is the Primary Cause of the Global Refugee Crisis

◆ The United States follows hegemonic and militaristic policies. Throughout the country's more than 240 years of history, only 16 years were without wars. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter candidly referred to the United States as ""the most warlike nation in the history of the world."" The country's aggressive behaviors have led to waves of refugees. Since 2001, U.S. invasions have resulted in over 800,000 deaths and 20 million refugees in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other affected countries. According to a Brown University project entitled ""the Costs of War,"" military operations launched by the United States in 85 countries in the name of ""fighting terrorism"" since 2001 have costed 6.4 trillion U.S. dollars and claimed more than 929,000 lives. Up to 38 million people were displaced in the fightings.

◆In Asia, U.S. involvement in the Korean War resulted in over three million civilian deaths and around three million refugees. The trauma of war persists to this day. Many Korean families were divided because of the long-standing confrontation on the Peninsula. Official data from the ROK alone indicate that the number of people registered as divided family members exceeds 132,000. Many senior citizens worry that to reunite with their families in the DPRK would be too distant a dream in their lifetime. In the 1970s, after losing the Vietnam War, the United States withdrew hastily from Saigon, displacing innumerable refugees out of the country.

◆In the Middle East, the United States launched the Iraq War based on fabricated evidence in 2003, in the absence of authorization of the UN Security Council and despite strong opposition from the international community. According to Statista, a global database, around 209,000 Iraqi civilians died in the war and ensuing violent conflicts between 2003 and 2021, and around 9.2 million Iraqis became refugees or were forced to leave their homeland. The United States involved itself deeply in the Syrian war and the internal conflict in Libya through multiple proxies, causing prolonged conflicts and leaving political settlement and social stability elusive. According to UN statistics, U.S. military intervention in Syria has left at least 350,000 people dead, 12 million displaced and 14 million in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The UN refers to the Syrian refugee problem as ""the biggest humanitarian and refugee crisis of our time"". According to estimates of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the war in Afghanistan, which lingered for more than two decades, has forced 2.6 million Afghans to flee the country and displaced 3.5 million.

◆In Europe, U.S. intervention in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the 1990s escalated ethnic tensions in the country. The wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo resulted in nearly 300,000 deaths and nearly three million refugees. In March 1999, NATO forces led by the United States blatantly bypassed the UN Security Council to carry out a 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia under the pretext of ""averting humanitarian disaster"", causing over 2,000 civilian deaths, over 6,000 injuries and around a million displaced people.

◆U.S. military interventions around the world triggered a refugee crisis in Europe. It is widely held in Europe that U.S. interference and military operations in such countries as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria gave rise to waves of refugees, but it is Europe, not the United States, that received them. Most of the affected people fled to Europe in the wake of the Syrian refugee crisis, exacerbating anti-immigrant sentiments and right-wing populist movements in Europe. By contrast, the Republican administration in the United States was tough on tak",China

270223,Following a Chinese Path of Human Rights Development and Contributing China’s Strength to Global Human Rights Governance,"Mr. President,
Dear Colleagues,

In October 2022, the Communist Party of China (CPC) held its 20th National Congress. A blueprint was drawn for advancing national rejuvenation through a Chinese path to modernization. The Chinese path of modernization provides another option to developing countries in their pursuit of modernization, and is China’s contribution to the exploration by humanity for a better social system.

The process of Chinese modernization is also a process of advancement in human rights. As President Xi Jinping stated, China will follow a Chinese path of human rights development, actively participate in global human rights governance, and promote all-round development of human rights. China has found a path of human rights development that meets the trend of the times and suits its national conditions. This path holds the key to the country’s historic achievements in human rights, and we will stay on this path going forward. 

For us, the biggest human right is the happiness of the 1.4 billion Chinese people. Meeting their immediate interests is what all our endeavors are about. The 1.4 billion people have been deeply involved in the development of human rights, and have benefited the most in this process. They now have a growing sense of fulfillment, happiness and security.  

In China, we have ended absolute poverty once and for all, completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects across the country, and put in place the world’s largest education, social security, and healthcare systems. Guided by the new development philosophy, we are pursuing high-quality development by fostering a new development paradigm, to promote common prosperity for all.

Under the constitutional principle that “The state shall respect and protect human rights”, we have comprehensively advanced law-based governance and enhanced legal safeguards for human rights, to uphold social fairness and justice. We have continuously developed the whole-process people’s democracy, under which the people enjoy more extensive, substantive and comprehensive democratic rights.

We advocate the common values of humanity, namely, peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, and practice true multilateralism. We have fully participated in UN human rights affairs, earnestly fulfilled our international human rights obligations, and put forward China’s propositions and initiatives. We have engaged in constructive dialogue and cooperation with the UN High Commissioner and other countries, and helped advance the reform and development of the global human rights governance system.       

Colleagues,

Seventy five years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was born from the ashes of the Second World War. The Declaration, affirming the respect for and protection of basic human rights, is a milestone in the international human rights cause. Thirty years ago, the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action established the equal status of all human rights. The vision of promoting human rights through development and cooperation has become more and more widely appreciated.

As we speak, the COVID-19 pandemic is still lingering. The global economy is at risk of a recession. Food and energy crises, disruptions to industrial and supply chains, climate change and other global problems keep emerging. The international human rights cause is facing severe challenges. Given these new circumstances and tasks, we need to ask ourselves: How to better promote and protect human rights? How to enhance and improve global human rights governance? In answering these questions, China wishes to propose the following:

— Committing to a path of human rights development that suits the realities of each country. “Human rights for all” is the shared pursuit of humanity. Meanwhile, countries vary from one another in historical background, cultural heritage, national conditions and needs of the people. There is no one-size-fits-all model in the protection of human rights. The right of all countries to independently choose one’s own path of human rights development should be respected. Blindly copying the model of others would be ill-fitted for one’s own conditions, and imposing one’s model upon others would entail endless troubles.  

— Committing to the comprehensive promotion and protection of all human rights. Human rights are indivisible. The right to subsistence and the right to development are basic human rights of primary importance. Civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights should be accorded equal attention and advanced in a holistic way. Just as all men are born equal, all countries are equal members of the international community. More attention should be paid to the human rights challenges facing developing countries and their human rights needs. Measures of unilateral coercion violate international law and the basic human rights of the people of the countries concerned, and should be lifted immediately and unconditionally.

— Committing to international fairness and justice. The advancement of the international human rights cause needs solidarity and cooperation, not division or confrontation. No country is qualified to act as the judge on human rights, and human rights should not be used as a pretext for meddling in other countries’ internal affairs or holding back other countries’ development. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter should be observed by all, and human rights exchanges and cooperation be carried out on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The acts by some to politicize, weaponize and instrumentalize human rights issues should be opposed. The practices of lecturing and finger-pointing on others’ human rights, while ignoring and failing to solve one’s own serious human rights problems should be rejected.

— Committing to dialogue and cooperation. The Human Rights Council should be a stage for constructive dialogue and cooperation, rather than an arena for political manipulation and bloc confrontation. The Council should be UN-membership-led. The human rights treaty bodies and the special procedures should operate within their mandates and build bridges of communication with member states. Only by following the principles of impartiality, objectivity, non-selectivity and non-politicization can the UN human rights system function well and bring continued positive energy to the international human rights cause.

Colleagues,

China is a unified multi-ethnic country. Its 56 ethnic groups, diverse yet tight-knit, are closely united like the seeds of a pomegranate. Together, they form a community of solidarity and mutual assistance of the Chinese nation. Some forces with hidden agenda keep hyping up issues related to China’s Xinjiang and Tibet, in an attempt to smear China and suppress its development. We firmly oppose such moves. We welcome all fair-minded people from across the world to China to visit more places and see more things, to learn what is truly happening on the ground.

Since the legislation on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong took effect, the city’s standing as an international financial, shipping and trading center has strengthened. Hong Kong remains in the lead in multiple global index rankings concerning the rule of law, safety and security, and business climate. The lawful rights and freedoms of its residents are better protected. Hong Kong is now at a new stage where it has restored order and is set to thrive. We will remain steadfast in fully and faithfully implementing the policy of One Country, Two Systems, firmly safeguard China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintain Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability. Hong Kong will embrace an even brighter tomorrow!

Planet Earth is our one and only home. When the Japanese government decided to release contaminated water of the Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea, this decision bears on the security of the global eco-environment and the right to health of people around the world. As many as 1.3 million tons of such water is to be discharged, containing over 60 kinds of radionuclides, some of which have no proven effective technology for treatment. Estimation shows the release will last 30 years. With the world’s strongest ocean currents along the Fukushima coast, these radionuclides would reach every corner of the oceans around the globe ten years after the discharge. This is not Japan’s private business. Countries should urge Japan to take the legitimate concern of the international community seriously, fulfill its due international obligations, and deal with the nuclear waste water in an open, transparent, science-based and safe manner.

Mr. President,

Colleagues,

As the new year starts, China is ready to work with all parties to advance the global cause of human rights protection, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

I wish this session of the Human Rights Council positive outcomes.

Thank you.  ",China

180223,Wang Yi: The US Should Show its Sincerity and Redress the Mistake,"On February 18, 2023 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi attended and delivered a keynote speech at the 59th Munich Security Conference in Germany. After the speech, he answered questions on China-US relations.

Wang Yi said the recent so-called “unmanned airship incident” has drawn extensive attention. In fact, it is a political farce manufactured by the United States. China explained very clearly to the US that it was a civilian unmanned airship, which, affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, deviated from its planned course and entered the US airspace. China asked the United States to work with the Chinese side to properly handle it in a rational, calm and professional manner. But regrettably, the US turned a blind eye to the basic facts and blatantly shot down the airship that posed no threat at all by firing a missile from a fighter jet. This mind-boggling and hysterical act is a hundred percent abuse of force and a clear violation of common practice and relevant international conventions. China will never stand for this, and has lodged strong protest with the US. Each day, balloons fly across the sky in large numbers. Does the United States want to shoot them all down? What the US has done is not a sign of strength, but exactly the opposite. China urges the US to stop doing such absurd things out of domestic political needs in state-to-state relations, and demands that the US show sincerity, redress the mistake, and face up to and undo the negative impact of the incident on China-US relations.

The deep-seated reason that a purely unexpected accident has caused such a big stir in China-US relations is that the US has been misled by misperception and strategic misjudgment about China. China's policy toward the US is clear and transparent, that is, mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and, based on these principles, exploring the right way for the two major countries with different social systems, histories and cultures to get along with each other. But the US takes a totally different policy toward China, regarding China as the most severe geopolitical challenge and strategic competitor. Driven by this misguided perception of China, the US is using all means available to contain and suppress China.

With regards to the US claim that it wants to compete with China, Wang Yi said that China has never been afraid of competition, but competition should be fair and rule-based. By introducing the CHIPS and Science Act, the US is using state power to suppress Chinese businesses. This is a hundred percent self-serving unilateralism, a complete violation of the WTO rules, and a serious disruption of the stability of international industrial and supply chains. Once a champion of free trade, the United States is now standing on the opposite side of free trade. What a historical irony it is. As an ancient Chinese saying goes, ""A virtuous man acquires wealth by honorable means” whereas a petty man gets what they want through trickery and extortion. Today’s US has abandoned all pretenses. It simply skips the trickery and go directly to extort. Such acts will not only damage the legitimate rights and interests of other countries, but also undermine the credibility and interests of the United States itself.

Wang Yi said China urges the United States to view China's development in an objective and unbiased light, pursue a positive and pragmatic China policy, and work together with China to bring China-US relations back on the track of sound and steady development. This not only serves the interests of the two countries and peoples, but also meets the common expectation of the international community.",China
060223,Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng Lodges Stern Representations with the US Embassy in China on the US Attack on a Chinese Unmanned Airship by Force,"On February 5, 2023, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng lodged, upon instruction, stern representations with the US Embassy in China on behalf of the Chinese government on the US attack on a Chinese unmanned civilian airship by force.

Xie Feng stressed that the entry of the strayed Chinese unmanned civilian airship into US airspace is a purely unexpected accident caused by force majeure. The fact is crystal-clear and allows for no misrepresentation or smearing. However, the United States, turning a blind eye to the fact, has obstinately used force against the civilian airship that is leaving the US airspace, in an apparent act of overreaction and a serious violation of the spirit of international law and international practice. What the US has done has severely impacted and undermined the efforts and progress the two sides have made in stabilizing China-US relations since the Bali summit. The Chinese side hereby expresses its firm objection to and strong protest over this, and urges the United States not to take any further actions that may undermine China's interests or escalate or expand tensions. The Chinese government is closely following the developments of the situation, will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese company concerned and firmly defend China's interests and dignity, and reserves the right to make further responses if necessary.",China

III. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction

Conclusion

Introduction

The United States has a longstanding practice of exerting frequent long-arm jurisdiction over other countries, including both its allies and countries with which it has hostile or strained relations. In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with U.S. ""arms"" stretching longer and longer. Examining cases of U.S. abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.

I. An Overview of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction

◆According to U.S. domestic law, long-arm jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over persons or entities domiciled or resident outside the territory of the sanctioning state. First established by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945), long-arm jurisdiction allows state courts to exercise in personam jurisdiction in civil and commercial cases where jurisdiction cannot be exercised because the defendant is not domiciled in the state, on the basis that the defendant has some ""minimum contacts"" with the state.

◆According to international law, the exercise of a country's jurisdiction over an extraterritorial person or entity generally requires that the person or entity or its conduct has a real and sufficient connection to that country. Yet the U.S. exercises long-arm jurisdiction on the basis of the ""minimum contacts"" rule, constantly lowering the threshold for application. Even the flimsiest connection with the United States, such as having a branch in the United States, using U.S. dollar for clearing or other financial services, or using the U.S. mail system, constitutes ""minimum contacts.""

◆To exercise long-arm jurisdiction, the United States has further developed the ""effects doctrine,"" meaning that jurisdiction may be exercised whenever an act occurring abroad produces ""effects"" in the United States, regardless of whether the actor has U.S. citizenship or residency, and regardless of whether the act complies with the law of the place where it occurred. The United States has also been expanding the scope of its long-arm jurisdiction to exert disproportionate and unwarranted jurisdiction over extraterritorial persons or entities, enforcing U.S. domestic laws on extraterritorial non-US persons or entities, and wantonly penalizing or threatening foreign companies by exploiting their reliance on dollar-denominated businesses, the U.S. market or U.S. technologies.

◆In essence, long-arm jurisdiction is an arbitrary judicial practice, wielded by the U.S. government on the strength of its national power and financial hegemony, to enforce extraterritorial jurisdiction over entities and individuals of other countries on the ground of its domestic law.

II. Exercise and Expansion of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction

◆In the many years of exercising such jurisdiction, the United States has gradually developed a massive, mutually reinforcing and interlocking legal system for long-arm jurisdiction, and continued to lower the threshold and expand its discretionary power, thus shaping long-arm jurisdiction into a tool for the United States to advance hegemonic diplomacy and pursue economic interests. Such practice disregards other countries' sovereignty, blatantly meddles in others' internal affairs, seriously damages the legitimate interests of other countries, and disrupts the normal order of international exchanges. The expansion of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is all-dimensional. Citing the ""minimum contacts"" rule and the ""effects doctrine,"" the United States has developed massive and complex legal and enforcement systems to support its long-arm jurisdiction which is expanding in scope and fields of application.

◆Long-arm jurisdiction has also become a means by which the United States abuses unilateral sanctions, especially secondary sanctions. To ensure the extraterritorial effects of U.S. sanction laws, the United States would usually exercise judicial authority to hold extraterritorial entities and individuals accountable for failing to comply with U.S. sanction laws. In addition to long-arm jurisdiction, administrative, economic, financial and other means would also be employed to implement its secondary sanctions.

◆Compulsory extraterritorial evidence collection is another important means of long-arm jurisdiction. In the judicial process involving other countries, the United States frequently takes unilateral compulsory measures to collect evidence outside its own territory, circumventing normal channels of judicial and law enforcement cooperation between countries. It would directly ask banks and Internet firms that have branches or are listed in the United States to provide evidence such as account information and data located outside the United States. When other countries try to raise démarche, the United States would always respond by citing excuses such as ""judicial independence"" or ""low efficiency in normal judicial assistance or law enforcement cooperation."" These typical examples of long-arm jurisdiction have severely damaged other countries' judicial sovereignty, and the legitimate rights and interests of those subjects of evidence collection.

◆The United States has put in place a whole-of-government system to practice long-arm jurisdiction, which features a division of labor among departments and inter-agency collaboration. The President and Congress are the main decision makers when it comes to sanctions. The President decides on most of the economic sanctions, and Congress participates through legislative activities under specific circumstances. At the heart of sanctions enforcement is the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), an agency under Treasury responsible for freezing assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction, formulating and adjusting lists of sanctioned individuals and entities, and reviewing and issuing licenses. The Department of State's Office of Economic Sanctions Policy and Implementation (SPI) is responsible for developing and implementing foreign policy-related sanctions. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), an agency of the Department of Commerce, administers separate lists from the OFAC. On top of these, the U.S. government bolsters its sanctions enforcement through control of SWIFT and CHIPS, two major cross-border payment and clearing systems, by pressing them, when it deems necessary, to cut off contact with the financial institutions of the subject country to achieve the purpose of economic sanctions.

◆The United States has stepped up legislation for long-arm jurisdiction. A wide range of laws in the United States advance long-arm jurisdiction, including Trading with the Enemy Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and Helms-Burton Act. Others such as the USA PATRIOT Act and National Defense Authorization Act contain long-arm jurisdiction clauses. A number of presidential executive orders also involve long-arm jurisdiction. More and more U.S. federal legislation contains long-arm jurisdiction clauses to prevent Americans from circumventing U.S. laws by establishing subsidiaries in foreign countries, or foreigners enjoying less restrictions than Americans, or relevant international rules-making hurting U.S. interests. These legislative moves allow the United States to enforce long-arm jurisdiction in its diplomacy by citing domestic laws.

◆There is a growing tendency of the U.S. applying long-arm jurisdiction to criminal cases, which is an extreme abuse of the practice. In recent years, a number of U.S. federal laws include extraterritorial clauses, which have been exploited by the Department of Justice to launch criminal investigations and prosecutions. In these proceedings, federal courts begin to apply the concept of long-arm jurisdiction when examining the basis of their jurisdiction by broadly interpreting the connection between the case and the United States, expanding the scope of personal and territorial jurisdiction, and lowering the threshold for the application of protective jurisdiction and general jurisdiction.

III. The Perils of U.S. Long-arm Jurisdiction

◆The United States is the only sanctions superpower in the world. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021,the number of active U.S. sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400.

◆Sanctions strain relations between countries and undermine the international order. Healthy state-to-state relations are the bedrock for peace and stability in the international order. In the 1990s, the United States introduced the Helms-Burton Act to impose economic sanctions through long-arm jurisdiction on individuals and entities worldwide conducting transactions with Cuba. It sparked strong opposition from the European Union, who in 1996 passed the Blocking Statute to neutralize through legislation the effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction within the EU, and enable individuals and entities in the EU to sue individuals and entities in the United States. Apart from this, the EU put forward a series of proposals and initiatives at the UN General Assembly, the Security Council, the World Trade Organization and other international bodies, calling on the international community to pay attention to the harmful effects of U.S. long-arm jurisdiction, and even resorted to the WTO dispute settlement procedures. So far, the ""long arm"" of U.S. jurisdiction has reached China, Russia, Iran, Syria, the DPRK, Cuba, France, the UK, Germany, Japan, among others. In an article published in Foreign Affairs, Professor Daniel Drezner of Tufts University criticized successive U.S. administrations for abusing economic coercion and economic violence and using sanctions as the preferred solution to diplomatic problems, which have been ineffective and causing humanitarian disasters.

◆Since 1979, the United States has imposed various types of unilateral sanctions on Iran and other countries. In 1996, it rolled out the D'Amato Act which forbids foreign companies from investing in the energy sector of Iran and Libya, resulting in long-term damaging ramifications. Afterward, the United States keeps ramping up sanctions against Iran. Under the Trump administration, it harbored a policy of ""maximum pressure"" and wanted to use sanctions to effect a regime change in Iran. According to then Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, sanctions under the Trump administration caused at least US$200 billion worth of economic damage to Iran; he condemned such sanctions as inhumane, a crime and an act of terrorism.

◆Between 1980 and 1992, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions on Libya, and from 1992 to 2003, it rallied or coerced allies into expanding sanctions against Libya. The World Bank noted that Libya suffered up to US$18 billion economic losses as a result of the sanctions, while an official Libyan estimate put the figure at 33 billion.

◆Crude U.S. sanctions on Iraq after the Gulf War brought about serious consequences. From August 1990 to May 2003, they caused a total loss of US$150 billion in Iraq's oil revenue. As a result, the country's per capita income falls below its 1990 level of US$7,050 even to this day. The sanctions have also caused a serious humanitarian disaster, with infant mortality rate doubling and the under-five mortality increasing six-fold. Meanwhile, Iraq's education, health and social security systems were destroyed; its literacy rate fell from 89 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in 1997.

◆Undermining the purposes and functions of various international governance mechanisms. The United States has frequently imposed unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework. In 2021 alone, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Department of Commerce and other agencies imposed various sanctions on as many as over 2,000 entities. As a result, the sanctioning function of the Security Council is undercut, seriously affecting its normal function of maintaining international peace and security. When the International Criminal Court (ICC) attempted to investigate suspected war crimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan, the United States, with itself not being a member of the Court, responded by launching sanctions against ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and senior official Phakiso Mochochoko, sparking unanimous outcry from the international community. Despite the ruling of the Dispute Settlement Body of WTO that its Section 301 procedures are a violation of international law, the United States continues to launch various unilateral Section 301 investigations on imports from China and other countries, and keeps all existing Section 301 tariffs unchanged. Such actions have directly sabotaged the tariff concessions achieved by many rounds of difficult negotiations of the multilateral trading system, blatantly trampled on the purposes and spirit of the multilateral trading system, and eroded the cornerstone of the system's operation.

◆Undermining the interests of companies of other countries. To maintain its economic and technological supremacy, the United States abuses its public power to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition. Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and fighting against human rights violations, it has adopted a package of measures including the Entity List and economic sanctions to restrict foreign enterprises from obtaining raw materials, items and technologies vital to their survival and development, sometimes even used secondary sanctions to cut those companies' normal trade with enterprises from other countries in an effort to disrupt their supply chains root and branch.

◆A case in point is the imprisonment of a senior manager from the French company Alstom. In 2013, in order to beat Alstom in their business competition, the United States applied the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to arrest and detain Frédéric Pierucci on charges of bribing foreign officials. He was further induced to sign a plea deal and provide more evidence and information against his company, leaving Alstom no choice but to accept General Electric's acquisition, vanishing ever since from the Fortune 500 list. The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has become a tool for its public power to suppress competitors and meddle in normal international business activities, announcing the United States’ complete departure from its long-standing self-proclaimed champion of liberal market economy.

◆In recent years, the United States has frequently employed the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act (2016) to impose unilateral sanctions on entities in various countries deemed to have engaged in ""serious human rights violations."" However, while exercising such unilateral sanctions, the United States has often violated the basic human rights of the sanctioned subjects disregarding the fact that their human rights are also entitled to protection.

◆When COVID-19 was raging in the world, the U.S. government did not relent in imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran, Syria and other countries, making it difficult for these countries to obtain the much-needed medical supplies to fight the virus. As a result of the sanctions, Iran has been cut off access to essential medicines and medical equipment, putting the health of millions of Iranians in jeopardy. To raise funds to fight the pandemic, the Iranian government applied to the IMF for a US$5 billion dollar exclusive loan, but the effort was blocked by the United States. Even worse, the United States prevented Iran from importing COVID vaccines by freezing its overseas funds and threatening vaccine suppliers. As the Brookings Institution estimated, during the height of the pandemic in Iran, U.S. sanctions further exacerbated the spread of the virus and could have caused up to 13,000 of deaths.

Conclusion

The U.S. long-arm jurisdiction is not something new. In spite of adaptations over time in its contents and measures, the nature of the U.S. long-arm jurisdiction has not changed: it has been, since the very beginning, a hegemonic tool to maintain U.S. hegemony, suppress foreign competitors, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and even subvert the governments of other countries. Over the last few years, the United States has abused long-arm jurisdiction by continuing to lower the threshold and intensifying measures to an unprecedented degree against wider range of targets. It not only undermines the principle of sovereign equality, violates international law, and erodes the multilateral order with the UN at its core, but also creates and intensifies tensions and conflicts among major countries, and poses a threat to the international security system established after World War II. It also interferes with and distorts normal international commercial exchanges and trade order, disrupts the supply chain of global trade, damages the interests of enterprises and raises their operating costs. The United States should renounce its illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction measures, and truly take up its international responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.",China
050123,The Planet’s Future Depends on a Stable China-U.S. Relationship,"On January 4, 2023, Ambassador Qin Gang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, published an article on The Washington Post. The full text is as follows:

“The end,” wrote the poet T.S. Eliot, “is where we start from.” As I leave the United States this week to start a new journey, memorable scenes from my time in this country keep flashing back in my mind.

I visited 22 states and discovered a country different from what I know in Washington, D.C. In the spring, I visited the Kimberley Farm in Iowa, which President Xi Jinping visited in 2012. I tried my hand at driving a John Deere tractor and tasted the local produce. In the fall, I visited a corn and soybean farm in Missouri and was deeply moved by my hosts’ sincerity and hospitality.

I saw with my own eyes how Chinese-American agricultural cooperation benefited both countries and contributed to both the global food supply and the fight against climate change. In Minneapolis, I taught a class to kids in a Chinese language immersion school, and one of the students there just won the Chinese Bridge language competition. I visited Chinese-owned factories in Ohio and California, as American workers explained that Chinese investments helped to put food on their tables. At the ports of Boston and Long Beach, I saw huge stacks of containers shipped from and to China, a testament to the high degree of economic interdependence between our two countries — and a reminder that decoupling serves no one’s interest.

At Busch Stadium in St. Louis, I threw out the first pitch at a Cardinals game to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of Nanjing-St. Louis sister-city relations, our two countries’ oldest such pairing. I celebrated, together with American friends, the 50th anniversary of the giant pandas’ arrival in the United States.

These are, for me, important memories about this country, and I will hold them in my heart. My posting in the United States will provide unfailing strength for me as a diplomat. Going forward, the development of China-U.S. relations will remain an important mission of mine in my new position.

I became ambassador to the United States at a complex and difficult time for China-U.S. relations. Almost all of the dialogue and exchange mechanisms were suspended. Chinese enterprises were unfairly sanctioned. Compounded by the pandemic, people-to-people exchanges were severely impacted. China was often described as America’s “most serious competitor.”

As ambassador, I took it as my mission to promote exchanges and cooperation in various fields, and work for the stability, improvement and development of China-U.S. relations. Improving relations takes work by both sides. I had candid dialogue and built sound working relations with U.S. government officials to properly handle thorny issues, such as the Taiwan question, and to advance cooperation in important areas.

I met with more than 80 members of Congress, including some well-known China hawks, to explain China’s positions and concerns, while lending an ear to theirs as well. I explored with think tanks on how to rebuild a stable, predictable and constructive framework for bilateral relations. I was encouraged by the business community’s confidence in the Chinese market and its strong desire for continued cooperation. I visited many American universities, and helped U.S. students who were kept from going to China because of the pandemic return to their Chinese campuses. I did many interviews with American media. Though we did not always see eye to eye, I appreciated their readiness to listen to the Chinese perspective.

I leave the United States more convinced that the door to China-U.S. relations will remain open and cannot be closed. I am also more convinced that Americans, just like the Chinese people, are broad-minded, friendly and hard-working. The future of both our peoples — indeed, the future of the entire planet — depends on a healthy and stable China-U.S. relationship.

My time here also reminds me that China-U.S. relations should not be a zero-sum game in which one side out-competes the other or one nation thrives at the expense of the other. The world is wide enough for China and the United States to both develop and prosper. The successes of our two countries are shared opportunities, not winner-take-all challenges. We must not allow prejudice or misperception to ignite confrontation or conflict between two great peoples. We should follow the strategic guidance of our presidents and find the right way to get along for the well-being of the world.

This will not be, as Americans sometimes say, a “walk in the park.” It requires the persistent efforts of everyone. However, history will prove that what we have begun is essential and worthwhile.

I will take all these memories with me when I go back. The poet Eliot also wrote, “To make an end is to make a beginning.” I believe that the relations between our countries will follow that path.",China
020123,"Ambassador Qin Gang, China's Foreign Minister Called US Secretary of State Antony Blinken","On January 1, 2023 local time, Ambassador Qin Gang, China's Foreign Minister, called US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to bid farewell. Qin Gang recalled a number of  candid, in-depth and constructive meetings with Secretary Blinken during his tenure as Chinese Ambassador to the United States. Qin expressed his hope to continue close working relations with Blinken for a better China-US relationship. They also exchanged New Year's greetings in the call.",China
231222,Wang Yi Has a Phone Call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On December 23, 2022, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the latter’s request.

Wang Yi said that President Xi Jinping's successful meeting with President Biden in Bali last month has provided strategic guidance for taking bilateral relationship out of severe difficulties and returning it to the track of sound and stable development, sending a positive signal to the outside world. The two teams have had a series of engagements in accordance with the common understandings between the two presidents, which are beneficial on the whole. But it must be pointed out that the United States should not pursue dialogue and cooperation while containing and stabbing China in the back. This is not reasonable competition, but unreasonable suppression; it is not managing differences, but aggravating problems. In effect, it is still the old trick of unilateral bullying. It has not worked with China in the past, nor will it work in the future. China will continue to resolutely defend its sovereignty, security and development interests. The US must take seriously China's legitimate concerns, stop containing and suppressing China's development, and particularly stop using salami tactics to constantly challenge China's red line.

Wang Yi stressed that the two sides should focus on translating the common understandings reached between the two presidents in Bali into practical policies and concrete actions. The Langfang meeting between the responsible officials of the two sides was in-depth and constructive. The two sides should step up consultations on the guiding principles of China-US relations, advance dialogue at all levels and in various fields in an orderly manner, and resolve specific issues between the two countries through the joint working group.

Wang Yi said that with the new year there should come new changes. People in both countries and the rest of the world are hoping to see a stabilizing and improving China-US relationship. The zero-sum mentality will only lead the two major countries to mutual attrition and head-on collision. And it cannot be more obvious who is in the right and who is in the wrong. How the China-US relationship will evolve depends on how the two sides will act. It is important that the two sides follow the course charted by the two presidents, explore the right way for China and the US to get along as two major countries, and make due efforts to advance the well-being of the two peoples and world peace and stability.

Blinken said that the US side is willing to discuss with China the guiding principles of bilateral relations, manage US-China relations responsibly, and carry out cooperation in areas that serve the common interests of the two sides. The US will continue to follow the one-China policy and does not support Taiwan's ""independence"".

Blinken said the US appreciates China's leadership and role as president of the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in reaching an ambitious framework for biodiversity conservation, and looks forward to joint effort with China to promote its implementation. Wang Yi said that China will continue to follow the Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization, and strive to build a community of life for man and nature. China is ready to work with all parties to safeguard the only planet we live together.

The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue. Wang Yi stressed that China always stands for peace, the purposes of the UN Charter, and international effort to promote peace talks. China will continue to play a constructive role in resolving the crisis in its own way.",China
221222,Wang Yi Meets with Co-Chair of Board of Trustees of Asia Society John L. Thornton,"On December 22, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Co-Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Asia Society John L. Thornton in Beijing.

Wang Yi said that to achieve stable and sustainable development of China-US relations, the US should first form a right perception of China, and uphold dialogue and win-win cooperation as the keynote of bilateral exchanges, not confrontation or zero-sum competition. Noting the important common understandings the two presidents reached on exploring and establishing the guiding principles of bilateral relations during their meeting in Bali, Wang said that China is willing and ready to find a right way for China and the US to get along with each other based on the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. It is imperative that the US abandon its unreasonable acts of containment and suppression of China, earnestly put President Biden's positive remarks into action, and return to the more positive and practical China policy.

Wang Yi said that facing recurring regional hotspot issues and global challenges like climate change and food and energy crises, China and the United States, as two major countries, should carry out necessary cooperation, play a leading role, and assume the due responsibility of major countries, which is also the common expectation of the international community. Wang noted that China is open to dialogue with the United States at all levels, and welcomes Mr. Thornton and other people from the US business, strategic, and academic communities to China for more face-to-face exchanges, so as to enhance mutual understanding between the two countries.

Thornton said that the United States and China should become strategic partners that can cooperate with each other. He expressed readiness to continue to play his role in promoting economic and trade exchanges between the two sides, enhancing Americans' overall understanding of China, and promoting the steady development of US-China relations.",China

President Xi said that his meeting with President Joe Biden in Bali is strategic and constructive, and carries important significance in guiding China-U.S. relations going forward. He expressed the hope that the two sides will further increase mutual understanding, reduce misperception and miscalculation, and work together to bring China-U.S. relations back on the track of healthy and steady development. It is hoped that Vice President Harris would play a positive role in this regard.

151122,Wang Yi Briefs the Media on the Meeting between Chinese and U.S. Presidents and Answers Questions,"On November 14, 2022 local time, President Xi Jinping had a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia. After the meeting, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi briefed the media on the meeting and answered questions.

Question one: President Xi Jinping has just held a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden. The meeting has been closely watched by the international community. Could you brief us on how the meeting went?

Wang Yi: President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had a face-to-face meeting in Bali this afternoon, as proposed by the U.S. side. The two heads of state had candid, in-depth, constructive and strategic discussions on major issues concerning China-U.S. relations and the prospects for world peace and development. The Chinese side has issued a press release on the meeting. I’d like to further share the following with you.

First, the meeting is very important. It features three ""firsts"" for the two leaders -- their first face-to-face meeting over the past three years, their first face-to-face summit since President Biden took office, and their first interaction  after China and the United States completed their respective major domestic agendas this year.

Second, the communication is very profound. The two leaders have known each other for many years, and they have had long and in-depth discussions during all their phone calls and video conferences. The Bali meeting is not only a continuation of their past exchanges, but also the signal of a new starting point. The meeting lasted more than three hours even with simultaneous interpretation, longer than previously scheduled. The exchanges are comprehensive, profound, and candid, as well as constructive and of strategic importance.

Third, meeting is rich in content. The two presidents discussed five topics, namely, their respective domestic and foreign policies, China-U.S. relations, the Taiwan question, dialogue and cooperation in various fields, and major international and regional issues. That virtually covered the most important aspects of the bilateral relations and the most pressing regional and global issues at the moment.

Fourth, the meeting provides guidance for the future. Head-of-state diplomacy is the compass and anchor of China-U.S. relations, and it plays an irreplaceable strategic role in guiding the growth of the relationship. At present, China-U.S. relations are facing serious difficulties and are at a critical crossroads regarding where to go from here. During their meeting, the two presidents played the leadership role to set the relationship on the right course and also laid out plans to this end.

President Xi Jinping briefed President Biden on the key outcomes and the important significance of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). He stressed that the domestic and foreign policies of the CPC and the Chinese government are open and transparent, with clearly stated and transparent strategic intentions and great continuity and stability. President Xi Jinping said that China-U.S. relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other, and that the world in the 21st century must avoid repeating the mistake of the Cold War. The two sides should form a correct perception of each other's domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions. China-U.S. interactions should be defined by dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation or zero-sum competition. President Biden briefed President Xi Jinping on the U.S. midterm elections, and stated that the United States respects China's system, it does not seek a new Cold War, it does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, and that it has no intention to have a conflict with China or to contain China.

The two presidents highlighted the global significance of China-U.S. relations. Both stressed the importance of working out the guiding principles for China-U.S. relations. Both expressed the hope to put bilateral relations back on a steady and upward trajectory. They agreed to strengthen communication and exchanges, and advance practical cooperation. This has charted the course ahead for China-U.S. relations, and will help bring bilateral relations back to the right track of sound and steady development.

Question two: All parties are following closely where China-U.S. relations are headed. Will the Bali summit meeting help stabilize the relationship or, as the U.S. side put it, ""build a floor"" for the relationship?

Wang Yi: This meeting will not only provide important, practical guidance for China-U.S. relations at the current stage, but will also have a major and far-reaching impact on the relationship in the next stage and even beyond.

First, the meeting identified a clear direction, that is, to prevent China-U.S. relations from getting derailed or out of control, and to find the right way for the two major countries to get along with each other. President Xi Jinping pointed out that the current state of China-U.S. relations is not in the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, and is not what the international community expects. China and the United States need to have a sense of responsibility for history, for the world and for the people, to ensure that their relations move forward on the right course without losing direction or speed, still less having a collision. President Biden said that a stable and prosperous China is good for the United States and the world. The United States and China have a shared responsibility to show the world that they can manage their differences, and avoid misperceptions or fierce competition from veering into confrontation or conflict.

Second, the meeting established a framework, i.e., jointly working out the guiding principles, or a strategic framework, for China-U.S. relations. President Xi Jinping said that it would be problematic if two major countries like China and the United States do not have overarching principled common understandings. Only with principles can there be a direction, and only with a direction can the two sides properly handle differences and expand cooperation. It is exactly out of this consideration that the Chinese side proposed that China and the United States should respect each other, coexist in peace and pursue win-win cooperation. President Biden has reiterated his ""five noes"" (i.e., not seek a new Cold War; not seek to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not against China; not support “Taiwan independence”; not look for conflict with China) and other important statements on multiple occasions. The two presidents agreed on the importance of working out the guiding principles China-U.S. relations, and further explored the topic with constructive discussions. They instructed their work teams to follow this up with consultations and strive for agreement as soon as possible on the basis of the common understandings already in place.

Third, the meeting kicked off a process, i.e., implementing the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state to manage and stabilize China-U.S. relations. Heads-of-state diplomacy is the highest form of diplomacy. The strategic guidance of the Bali summit for bilateral relations is reflected in many aspects, including not only the important preparations for the Bali meeting but also the follow-ups afterwards. Managing and stabilizing China-U.S. relations is an ongoing process to which there's no end. In accordance with the priorities identified by the two heads of state, the two teams will maintain dialogue and communication, manage tensions and differences, and advance exchanges and cooperation, so as to add positive energy and a safety valve to China-U.S. relations, and bring about stability and certainty to this turbulent and changing world.

It must be pointed out that China has its own principles and red lines that it has long upheld, and has legitimate and lawful interests that must be firmly protected. China will not yield to any acts of hegemonism or bullying. The U.S. side should earnestly translate President Biden's positive statements into concrete policies and actions, stop containing and suppressing China, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and stop undermining China's sovereignty, security and development interests. The U.S. should work with China in the same direction to build pillars for the sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations and jointly cement a strong ""floor"" for the steady and sustained growth of the relationship.

Question three: The Taiwan question was definitely a focus of this meeting. Can you brief us on the conversation between the two leaders on the Taiwan question?

Wang Yi: Taiwan is part of China, and the Taiwan question is China's internal affair. The reason why China and the United States had to discuss the Taiwan question was because the United States interfered in China's internal affairs. What we ask from the United States is very clear -- stop interfering in China's internal affairs and respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

During the Bali meeting, President Xi Jinping shared with President Biden the history of Taiwan being colonized and invaded by external forces in the past several hundred years. He stressed that the very purpose of China's opposition to ""Taiwan independence"" and its efforts to protect territorial integrity is to guard and look after the land that has always belonged to China throughout the generations. Anyone that seeks to split Taiwan from China will be violating the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. The Chinese people will absolutely not accept this. They will be united as one to fight such attempt.

President Xi pointed out that China will stay committed to the basic policies of peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems, and will strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort. However, should the three types of serious events that are stipulated in the Anti-Secession Law take place, China will surely act in accordance with the Law. China hopes for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait more than anyone else in the world, but cross-Strait peace and stability and ""Taiwan independence"" are as irreconcilable as water and fire. For the Taiwan Strait to remain peaceful and stable, there should be staunch opposition to and efforts to curb ""Taiwan independence"".

President Xi stressed that the Taiwan question is “the core of the core interests of China”, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the red line that the United States must not and should not cross in China-U.S. relations. China urges the U.S. side to match its words with action, abide by the one-China policy and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, fulfill its commitment of ""not supporting 'Taiwan independence'"", stop fudging and hollowing out the one-China policy, restrain and stop ""Taiwan independence"" separatist rhetorics and activities, and prevent the situation from moving to a point of no return.

President Biden said that the U.S. government is committed to the one-China policy, and that the U.S. does not support ""Taiwan independence"", does not support ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"", and does not seek to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China.



Question four: China and the United States are permanent members of the UN Security Council. The whole international community hopes that China and the United States will work together to address various global challenges. What progress has China and the United States made in bilateral and multilateral cooperation?

Wang Yi: The history of China-U.S. relations shows that China and the United States both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Against the backdrop of a swirling combination of a global pandemic and major changes, both unseen in a century, as well as unprecedented challenges facing human society, China and the United States, as two major countries, must strengthen cooperation in bilateral and multilateral areas and work with other countries to overcome difficulties. This not only serves the interests of China and the United States, but also meets the common expectation of the international community.

During the meeting, President Xi Jinping said that China-U.S. cooperation is good for both countries and the world. There are differences between China and the United States, but they should not become an obstacle to growing China-U.S. relations. Instead they should serve as a driving force for exchanges and cooperation. Cooperation requires a good atmosphere and stable relations. It is not one side drawing up a laundry list of demands to the other side. It is about accommodating each other's concerns, and should be a process of give-and-take. No matter what the state China-U.S. relations are in, the two countries must not be less willing to fulfill their responsibilities as major countries in international affairs.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that China and the United States should work together to make the list of cooperation longer rather than shorter. The two presidents agreed that their teams may continue dialogue on macroeconomic policies, and economic and trade ties, and the two countries will jointly work for the positive results of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The two sides will work together on the implementation of the two cooperation documents in the fields of public health and agriculture, encourage and support China-U.S. people-to-people exchanges, and expand such exchanges in all sectors. The two sides will continue to carry out consultations of the China-U.S. joint working group to resolve more specific issues.

Facts have proven time and again that the entire China-U.S. relations cannot be simply defined by competition. Cooperation will always remain the best option for China and the United States. China-U.S. cooperation benefits all parties and opens up a win-win future for both China and the United States and for the whole world.

Question five: What other important issues of common concern did the two sides exchange views on?

Wang Yi: President Xi Jinping made clear China's position and attitude on some major issues of interest to the United States and the international community.

On democracy and human rights, President Xi Jinping noted that freedom, democracy and human rights are the common pursuit of humanity and also the unwavering pursuit of the CPC. Just as the United States has American-style democracy, China has Chinese-style democracy; both fit their respective national conditions. The whole-process people's democracy practiced in China is based on the country's reality, history and culture, and it reflects people's will. The specific differences between the two sides can be worked out through discussion, but only on the precondition of equality. To define one's own country as democratic and other countries as authoritarian is in itself undemocratic. The so-called ""democracy vs. authoritarianism"" narrative is a false one. It is not the defining feature of today's world, still less does it represent the trend of the times.

On social systems and paths, President Xi Jinping pointed out that the two countries take different paths; while the United States practices capitalism, China practices socialism. Such difference has existed since Day One of China-U.S. engagement and will continue to exist. For China and the United States to get along, it is vital to recognize and respect such difference. The leadership of the CPC and China's socialist system have the support of 1.4 billion people. They are the fundamental guarantee for China's development and stability. Attempting to subvert the leadership of the CPC and China's socialist system would mean stepping on the bottom line and crossing the red line, which will undermine the foundation of bilateral relations.

On economic ties and trade, President Xi Jinping noted that China-U.S. economic and trade relations benefit both sides. Waging a trade war or a technology war, building walls and barriers, and pushing for decoupling and severing supply chains run counter to the principles of market economy, and undermine international trade rules. Such attempts serve no one's interests. China will unswervingly pursue reform and opening-up, and rely on our own to promote development and progress of the country. The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Any suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people. If the United States decides to go further down on the doomed path of decoupling, it will ultimately backfire on the U.S. itself.

Question six: The international community is paying close attention to the Ukraine crisis and the issues on the Korean Peninsula. How did the two sides interact on these issues?

Wang Yi: The two presidents had an in-depth exchange of views on international and regional issues, including the Ukraine issue and the Korean nuclear issue.

On the Ukraine issue, President Xi reiterated the four points about what must be done and the four things the international community must do together in response to the situation in Ukraine. He stressed that the pressing priority is to seek a peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis through dialogue and negotiation. The use of nuclear weapons must be rejected, and nuclear war must never be fought. The world needs to prevent a nuclear crisis on the Eurasian continent. Joint efforts should also be made to ensure the stability of the global industrial and supply chains to avoid an even larger humanitarian crisis. China has all along stood on the side of peace and will continue to encourage peace talks.

On the Korean nuclear issue, President Xi Jinping elaborated on China's set position, and stressed the need for the parties to face up to the crux of the issues on the Korean Peninsula and resolve each other's concerns in a balanced manner, especially the legitimate concerns of the DPRK.

Question seven: You just talked about the significance of this meeting and the common understandings reached. What are the follow-up arrangements between the two sides?

Wang Yi: During this meeting, the two presidents agreed to maintain regular contact. They also instructed their diplomatic and national security teams to continue strategic communication to follow up on the major issues the two leaders discussed and implement the important common understandings reached between them.

The U.S. side said that Secretary of State Antony Blinken hopes to visit China at an early date to follow up on the subsequent work of the meeting. China welcomes this. The financial, economic and trade teams of the two countries will also conduct communication and coordination on macroeconomic policies, and China-U.S. economic and trade relations, among other issues.

To sum up, the Bali meeting has achieved the intended purpose of having in-depth communication, clarifying intentions, making clear where the red lines are, preventing conflicts, setting the direction and exploring cooperation.",China
151122,"Working Together to Meet the Challenges of Our Times and
Build a Better Future","Your Excellency President Joko Widodo,
Colleagues,

It gives me great pleasure to attend the G20 Bali Summit. At the outset, I wish to thank President Joko Widodo and the Indonesian government for making these thoughtful arrangements for the Summit. I also salute the Indonesian presidency for its important role in promoting G20 cooperation.

We meet at a time of momentous changes unseen in a century, changes that are consequential to the world, to our times, and to history. The COVID-19 pandemic still drags on with cases surging here and there. The world economy is getting more fragile. The geopolitical environment remains tense. Global governance is seriously inadequate. Food and energy crises are compounded with one another. All this poses formidable challenges to our development.

Faced with these challenges, it is imperative that all countries embrace the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, and advocate peace, development, and win-win cooperation. All countries should replace division with unity, confrontation with cooperation, and exclusion with inclusiveness. All countries should join hands together to answer the question of our times — “what is wrong with this world, what we should do about it” — so as to tide over difficulties and create a better future together.

All G20 members should take the responsibility inherent in being major international and regional players, and should lead by example in promoting development of all nations, improving the well-being for the whole mankind, and advancing progress of the entire world.

— We should make global development more inclusive. Solidarity is strength, but division leads nowhere. Living in the same global village, we should stand with each other in the face of risks and challenges. Drawing ideological lines or promoting group politics and bloc confrontation will only divide the world, and hinder global development and human progress. With human civilization already in the 21st century, the Cold-War mentality has long been outdated. What we need to do is to join hands together and elevate our win-win cooperation to a new height.

Countries should respect each other, seek common grounds while reserving differences, live together in peace, and promote an open world economy. No one should engage in beggar-thy-neighbor practices, building “a small yard with high fences”, or creating closed and exclusive clubs.

I always believe that the G20 should stay committed to its founding purpose of unity and cooperation, carry forward the spirit of solidarity, and uphold the principle of consensus. “Sugarcane and lemongrass grow in dense clumps.” This Indonesian proverb well captures the value of solidarity. Division and confrontation serve no one’s interest. Only solidarity and common development is the right choice to make.

— We should make global development beneficial to all. Development is real only when allcountries develop together. Prosperity and stability cannot be possible in a world where the rich become richer while the poor are made poorer. Every nation aspires for a better life, and modernization is not a privilege reserved for any single country. Frontrunners in development should sincerely help others develop, and provide more global public goods. All major countries should perform their due responsibilities, and do their best for the cause of global development.

The Global Development Initiative (GDI) that I proposed is aimed at meeting the long-term objective and immediate needs of common development of the world, fostering international consensus on promoting development, cultivating new drivers for global development, and facilitating common development and progress of all countries.

Within one year, more than 60 countries have joined the Group of Friends of the GDI. China has established the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund, and will increase its funding for the China-UN Peace and Development Fund. We will make a list of items for practical cooperation, set up an open-ended pool of GDI projects, and draw up a roadmap for GDI implementation. We are working with 100-plus countries and international organizations on the GDI, thus providing new impetus for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. China has submitted 15 projects to the “G20 Action for Strong and Inclusive Recovery”, and has participated in five other projects within this framework. We will work with fellow G20 members to deliver on these projects.

— We should make global development more resilient. Economic globalization is encountering headwinds, and the world economy is at risk of recession. Everyone is having a hard time, but developing countries are bearing the brunt. It is therefore more imperative than ever for us to focus on the issue of development. The theme of the Bali Summit, “Recover Together, Recover Stronger”, sends a positive message of the G20’s commitment to supporting the growth of developing countries and preventing divergent and unbalanced global recovery. We need to build a global partnership for economic recovery, prioritize development and put the people at the center, always keep in mind the difficulties faced by developing countries, and accommodate their concerns. China supports the African Union in joining the G20.

All parties should continue to deepen international cooperation against COVID-19, and raise the accessibility and affordability of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostic and treatment methods in developing countries so as to create a sound environment for economic recovery. We should curb global inflation, and defuse systemic economic and financial risks. In particular, developed economies should mitigate the negative spillovers from their monetary policy adjustment, and keep their debts at sustainable levels. The IMF should speed up the on-lending of SDRs to low-income countries. International financial institutions and commercial creditors, which are the main creditors of developing countries, should take part in the debt reduction and suspension for developing countries. China is implementing the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in all respects, and has suspended the largest amount of debt service payment among all G20 members. Meanwhile, China is working with some G20 members on the debt treatment under the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI, thus helping relevant developing countries navigate through the difficult time.

Global trade, digital economy, green transition and fighting corruption are key factors driving global development. We should continue to uphold the WTO-centered multilateral trading system, actively push forward WTO reform, enhance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and promote an open world economy. China has proposed the G20 Action Plan on Digital Innovation and Cooperation. We look forward to working with all parties to foster an open, fair, and non-discriminatory environment for digital economy so as to narrow the North-South digital divide. In tackling climate change and transitioning toward green and low-carbon development, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld. It is also important to provide funding, technology and capacity-building support for developing countries and promote cooperation on green finance. International cooperation is very important for fighting corruption. G20 members must maintain zero tolerance for corruption, step up international cooperation on fugitive repatriation and asset recovery, and refuse to provide “safe havens” to corrupt individuals and assets.

Global development would be impossible without a peaceful and stable international environment. With this in mind, I have put forward the Global Security Initiative (GSI). Our goal is to work with all parties to champion the spirit of the UN Charter, act on the principle of indivisible security, uphold the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, advocate the resolution of conflicts through negotiation and settlement of disputes through consultation, and support all efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of crises.

Colleagues,

Food and energy security is the most pressing challenge in global development. The root cause of the ongoing crises is not production or demand, but interrupted supply chains and international cooperation. The way out of this is for all countries to, with the coordination of the UN and other multilateral international organizations, enhance cooperation on market supervision and regulation, build partnerships on commodities, develop an open, stable and sustainable commodities market, and work together to unclog supply chains and stabilize market prices.

We must resolutely oppose the attempt to politicize food and energy issues or use them as tools and weapons. Unilateral sanctions must be removed, and restrictions on relevant scientific and technological cooperation must be lifted. In reducing the consumption of fossil fuel energy and transitioning toward clean energy, we need to give balanced consideration to various factors, and make sure that the transitional process does not hurt the economy or people’s livelihood. Developing countries face more acute risks in food and energy security. The G20 should keep this in mind, and provide necessary support in production, collection, storage, funding and technology. Since the UN has established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, the G20 should voice its support for it.

Over the years, China has made major contribution to global food and energy security. This year, China has proposed, together with six partners including Indonesia and Serbia, the Initiative of International Cooperation on Resilient and Stable Industrial and Supply Chains, joined other countries in calling for the establishment of the Global Clean Energy Cooperation Partnership, and put forward the International Cooperation Initiative on Global Food Security in the G20. We look forward to deepening cooperation with all parties in these areas.

Colleagues,

The Communist Party of China has recently convened its 20th National Congress, laying out the goals, tasks and guiding policies for the cause of the Party and the country in the next five years and beyond. China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development, stay committed to deepening reform and opening-up, and stay committed to promoting national rejuvenation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. A China marching toward modernization will bring more opportunities to the world, inject stronger momentum for international cooperation, and make greater contribution to human progress!

Thank you.",China
141122,President Xi Jinping Meets with U.S. President Joe Biden in Bali,"On the afternoon of 14 November local time, President Xi Jinping had a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia. The two presidents had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on issues of strategic importance in China-U.S. relations and on major global and regional issues.

President Xi pointed out the current state of China-U.S. relations is not in the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, and is not what the international community expects. China and the United States need to have a sense of responsibility for history, for the world and for the people, explore the right way to get along with each other in the new era, put the relationship on the right course, and bring it back to the track of healthy and stable growth to the benefit of the two countries and the world as a whole.



President Xi expounded on the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and its key outcomes. He pointed out that the domestic and foreign policies of the CPC and the Chinese government are open and transparent, with clearly stated and transparent strategic intentions and great continuity and stability. We are advancing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, basing our efforts on the goal of meeting people’s aspirations for a better life, unswervingly pursuing reform and opening-up, and promoting the building of an open global economy. China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, always decides its position and attitude based on the merits of issues, and advocates resolving disputes peacefully through dialogue and consultation. China is committed to deepening and expanding global partnerships, safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, and building a community with a shared future for mankind. China will stay committed to peaceful development, open development and win-win development, participate in and contribute to global development, and pursue common development with countries across the world.

President Xi pointed out that the world is at a major inflection point in history. Countries need to both tackle unprecedented challenges and seize unprecedented opportunities. This is the larger context in which we should view and handle China-U.S. relations. China-U.S. relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other. The successes of China and the United States are opportunities, not challenges, for each other. The world is big enough for the two countries to develop themselves and prosper together. The two sides should form a correct perception of each other’s domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions. China-U.S. interactions should be defined by dialogue and win-win cooperation, not confrontation and zero-sum competition. President Xi said that he takes very seriously President Biden’s “five-noes” statement. China does not seek to change the existing international order or interfere in the internal affairs of the United States, and has no intention to challenge or displace the United States. The two sides should respect each other, coexist in peace, pursue win-win cooperation, and work together to ensure that China-U.S. relations move forward on the right course without losing direction or speed, still less having a collision. Observing the basic norms of international relations and the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués is vitally important for the two sides to manage differences and disagreements and prevent confrontation and conflict; indeed, it is the most important guardrail and safety net for China-U.S. relations.



President Xi gave a full account of the origin of the Taiwan question and China’s principled position. He stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and China’s internal affair. It is the common aspiration of the Chinese people and nation to realize national reunification and safeguard territorial integrity. Anyone that seeks to split Taiwan from China will be violating the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation; the Chinese people will absolutely not let that happen! We hope to see, and are all along committed to, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, but cross-Strait peace and stability and “Taiwan independence” are as irreconcilable as water and fire. We hope that the U.S. side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués. President Biden has said on many occasions that the United States does not support “Taiwan independence” and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the U.S. side will act on this assurance to real effect. 

President Xi noted that freedom, democracy and human rights are the common pursuit of humanity and also the unwavering pursuit of the CPC. Just as the United States has American-style democracy, China has Chinese-style democracy; both fit their respective national conditions. The whole-process people’s democracy practiced in China is based on the country’s reality, history and culture, and it reflects people’s will. We take great pride in it. No country has a perfect democratic system, and there is always a need for development and improvement. The specific differences between the two sides can be worked out through discussion, but only on the precondition of equality. The so-called “democracy versus authoritarianism” narrative is not the defining feature of today’s world, still less does it represent the trend of the times.

President Xi pointed out that the two countries take different paths; while the United States practices capitalism, China practices socialism. Such difference is nothing new and will continue to exist. Leadership of the CPC and China’s socialist system have the support of 1.4 billion people. They are the fundamental guarantee for China’s development and stability. For China and the United States to get along, it is vital to recognize and respect such difference. Neither side should try to remold the other in one’s own image, or seek to change or even subvert the other’s system. Instead of talking in one way and acting in another, the United States needs to honor its commitments with concrete action.

President Xi underscored that China and the United States are two major countries with different histories, cultures, social systems and development paths. There have been and will continue to be differences between the two countries. Such differences should not become an obstacle to growing China-U.S. relations. There is always competition in the world, but competition should be about learning from each other to become one’s better self and make progress together, not about taking others down in a zero-sum game. The Chinese nation has the proud tradition of standing up for itself. Suppression and containment will only strengthen the will and boost the morale of the Chinese people. Starting a trade war or a technology war, building walls and barriers, and pushing for decoupling and severing supply chains run counter to the principles of market economy and undermine international trade rules. Such attempts serve no one’s interests. We oppose politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade ties as well as exchanges in science and technology. Under the current circumstances, China and the United States share more, not less, common interests. It is in our mutual and fundamental interest to prevent conflict and confrontation and achieve peaceful coexistence. The two economies are deeply integrated, and both face new tasks in development. It is in our mutual interest to benefit from each other’s development. It is also in our mutual interest to promote post-COVID global recovery, tackle climate change and resolve regional issues through China-U.S. coordination and cooperation. The two sides need to respect each other, pursue mutual benefit, focus on the larger picture, and nurture a sound atmosphere and stable relations for cooperation.



President Biden noted that he has known President Xi for many years and maintained regular communication, but nothing could substitute for the kind of face-to-face meeting today. President Biden congratulated President Xi on his re-election as General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee. As two major countries, the United States and China have a responsibility to keep a constructive relationship. The U.S. side is committed to keeping the channels of communication open between the two presidents and at all levels of government, so as to allow candid conversations on issues where the two sides disagree, and to strengthen necessary cooperation and play a key role in addressing climate change, food security and other important global challenges. This is vitally important to the two countries and peoples, and also very important to the whole world. President Biden reaffirmed that a stable and prosperous China is good for the United States and the world. The United States respects China’s system, and does not seek to change it. The United States does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, does not support “Taiwan independence”, does not support “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”, and has no intention to have a conflict with China. The U.S. side has no intention to seek “de-coupling” from China, to halt China’s economic development, or to contain China.

President Biden said that how the U.S-China relationship develops is of crucial importance to the future of the world. The United States and China have a shared responsibility to show the world that they can manage their differences, and avoid and prevent misunderstandings and misperceptions or fierce competition from veering into confrontation or conflict. The U.S. side shares the view that it is necessary to work out the principles guiding U.S.-China relations. The two teams may continue discussions on the basis of the common understandings already in place, and strive for early agreement. The U.S. government is committed to the one-China policy. It does not seek to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China, and hopes to see peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.

The two presidents agreed that their respective diplomatic teams should maintain strategic communication and conduct regular consultations; their financial teams will continue dialogue and coordination on macroeconomic policies, economic ties and trade; and the two countries will jointly work for the success of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The two sides reached common understandings on conducting dialogue and cooperation in public health, agriculture and food security. They agreed to make good use of the China-U.S. joint working group to promote the resolution of more issues. They also agreed that people-to-people exchange is very important, and agreed to encourage the expansion of such exchange in all sectors.

The two presidents also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis and other issues. President Xi pointed out that China is highly concerned about the current situation in Ukraine. He noted the four points about what must be done he had proposed soon after the outbreak of the crisis and the four things the international community must do together he had suggested recently. Facing a global, composite crisis like the one in Ukraine, it is important to give serious thought to the following: first, conflicts and wars produce no winner; second, there is no simple solution to a complex issue; and third, confrontation between major countries must be avoided. China has all along stood on the side of peace and will continue to encourage peace talks. We support and look forward to a resumption of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. At the same time, we hope that the United States, NATO and the EU will conduct comprehensive dialogues with Russia.

Both presidents viewed the meeting as in-depth, candid and constructive. They instructed their teams to promptly follow up and implement the important common understandings reached between them, and take concrete actions to put China-U.S. relations back on the track of steady development. The two presidents agreed to maintain regular contact.

141122,Xi Jinping: Put China-U.S. relationship on the right course and bring it back to the track of healthy and stable growth,"On the afternoon of 14 November local time, President Xi Jinping had a meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in Bali, Indonesia. 

President Xi pointed out that from the initial contact and the establishment of diplomatic relations to today, China and the United States have gone through 50-plus eventful years, with gains and losses as well as experience and lessons. History is the best textbook. We should take it as a mirror and let it guide the future. Currently, the state of China-U.S. relations is not in the fundamental interests of our two countries and peoples. It is not what the international community expects from us either. As leaders of two major countries, we need to play the leadership role, set the right course for the China-U.S. relationship and put it on an upward trajectory. A statesman should think about and know where to lead his country. He should also think about and know how to get along with other countries and the wider world.

President Xi emphasized that, in this time and age, great changes are unfolding in ways like never before. Humanity is confronted with unprecedented challenges. The world has come to a crossroads. Where to go from here? This is a question that is not just on our mind, but also on the mind of all countries. The world expects that China and the United States will properly handle their relationship. Our meeting today has attracted the world’s attention. We should work with all countries to bring more hope to world peace, greater confidence in global stability, and stronger impetus to common development. As always, I am ready to have a candid and in-depth exchange of views with you on issues of strategic importance in China-U.S. relations and on major global and regional issues. I also look forward to working with you to bring China-U.S. relations back to the track of healthy and stable growth to the benefit of our two countries and the world as a whole.",China
311022,Wang Yi Speaks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the Phone,"On October 31, 2022, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the phone at the latter's request. They exchanged views on China-U.S. relations at the current time and for some time to come.

Blinken said that the U.S. side has followed closely the 20th CPC National Congress, and studied carefully the report to the 20th National Congress. Wang Yi said that the 20th National Congress is a congress for unity, democracy and progress. The most important achievement of the Congress is the establishment of General Secretary Xi Jinping's core position on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole and the establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guiding ideology to be adhered to over the long term, which reflects the common will of the whole Party and people across the country. China will continue to unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has been proved to be a success. The policies of the Party and the Chinese government will maintain high-level consistency and stability. The important message sent by the Congress to the outside world is that China will stay committed to its foreign policy goals of upholding world peace and promoting common development, continue to pursue its fundamental national policy of opening to the outside world, and advance overall progress of humanity with Chinese modernization and bring new opportunities to the world with China's new development. This is the biggest stabilizing factor that China provides to the unstable international landscape. Wang Yi said that if the U.S. side truly wants to understand China, it needs to study carefully the report to the 20th National Congress. China's domestic and foreign policies are open and transparent, and its strategic intention is above board. The U.S. side should no longer have subjective conjectures with self-imposed bias, still less blind the eyes with ideological bias.

Wang Yi noted that steering China-U.S. relations back to the track of steady development not only serves the mutual interests of China and the United States, but also meets the prevailing expectation of the international community. The U.S. side should stop its move of suppressing and containing China, and not create new obstacles for bilateral relations. The introduction of new regulations on controlling export to China and restrictions on investment in China by the United States seriously violates free trade rules, and seriously undermines China's legitimate rights and interests, and it must be corrected.

Blinken said that the world expects cooperation between the U.S. and China. The United States is ready to maintain communication and carry out cooperation with China on U.S.-China relations at the next stage, to explore the foundation of bilateral relations.

The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue and others. Wang Yi stressed that all parties should stay calm and exercise restraint in decision-making, step up diplomatic efforts, and prevent the situation from further escalating or even getting out of control. As long as there is a glimmer of hope, the door to negotiations should not be closed; as long as there is one percent of possibility, one hundred percent of efforts must be made for peace.",China
230922,"The Right Way for China and the United States 
to Get Along in the New Era","President Kevin Rudd of the Asia Society,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is good to be back in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, and meet friends again after an interval of three years.

In the last few years, a lot has happened in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc; the global economy is in danger of a recession; and the Ukraine crisis has persisted and escalated. Issues involving food, energy, industrial and supply chains and climate change have become more acute.

The past few years have seen China-U.S. relations at a low ebb since the establishment of diplomatic ties. The reality of China-U.S. interdependence is ignored; the history of our win-win cooperation is misrepresented; channels of dialogue and communication are blocked. And the bilateral relationship is being defined and impacted dangerously by so-called strategic competition. This is bringing tremendous uncertainty to the future of our peoples and to countries across the world.

It is widely held that China-U.S. relations have well exceeded the bilateral scope and carry implications for the whole world. The global community expects China and the U.S. to take the lead, fulfill the responsibility as major countries, keep the bilateral ties stable and advance global cooperation.

Since last year, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden have had several rounds of strategic communication in flexible ways. President Xi pointed out that whether China and the U.S. can handle their relationship well bears on the future of the world. It is a question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer. President Biden said that the U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world, and how this relationship develops will shape the world in the 21st century.

Both Presidents agree that they should make the China-U.S. relationship work and not mess it up. They both believe the two countries should steer clear of conflict and confrontation. And they both stand for closer bilateral exchanges and cooperation. President Biden stressed many times that the U.S. does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China’s system; the revitalization of its alliances is not against China; the U.S. does not support “Taiwan independence”; and it is not looking for conflict with China. People around the world hope that these important statements are translated into real actions.

If two fine orchestras are to work together harmoniously, their conductors must first set the same tone, and all the players must follow the same music score. However, what has happened is that the U.S. team seems to have two different sets of music score. Their leader’s political will of a stable bilateral relationship has yet to be translated into logical policies. The Chinese people and people from other countries find this confusing, and would naturally raise questions:

How will the U.S. deliver on its promise of not aiming to change China’s system, when it has framed a false narrative of “democracy versus authoritarianism”, a narrative that deliberately amplifies an ideological confrontation with China and takes aim at China’s political system, development path and governing party?

How can a new Cold War be prevented, when the U.S. has, identifying China as the primary rival and the most serious long-term challenge, engaged in all-round containment, sought to encircle China by shaping the strategic environment around it, pressed other countries to pick sides and formed various small circles that exclude China?

How will the U.S. honor its important statement of not supporting “Taiwan independence” when it has, regardless of China’s strong opposition, allowed its House Speaker to visit Taiwan again after 25 years, kept elevating substantive relations with Taiwan by repeated official exchanges and arms sales including many offensive weapons, and is advancing the deliberation of the “Taiwan Policy Act” that threatens the very foundation of China-U.S. relations underpinned by the three Joint Communiqués?

And how to keep the industrial and supply chains between China and the U.S. and of the world stable, when the U.S. prolongs the trade war with China, keeping in place the extra tariffs on US$360 billion of Chinese goods though ruled inconsistent with the WTO rules, and extending the list of Chinese companies under its sanctions to over 1,000 entities and individuals?

The United States has, on the one hand, made repeated provocations on issues involving China’s core interests and development rights and interests, yet on the other, expressed a desire to keep the bilateral ties stable and prevent conflict and confrontation. This is self-contradictory in both logic and reality.

What is the crux of the matter? It boils down to how the United States perceives China, the world and itself. Be it full confrontation or strategic competition, both have deviated from the right course of China-U.S. relations.

Such deviations are dangerous and come at a high price. Mr. Kevin Rudd described the current China-U.S. relations as in a workshop with exposed wires and cables lying everywhere, water on the floor and sparks flying. Mr. Joseph Nye compared the relations to a sleepwalking syndrome that could stumble into a new Cold War. Should the United States handle its relations with China with a zero-sum mindset and continue to let “political correctness” misguide its China policy, it won’t find solutions to its own problems, but lead China-U.S. relations to conflict and confrontation. The message we must send, loud and clear, is that now is the time to make serious reflections and get back onto the right track!

Ladies and Gentlemen,

This year marks the 50th anniversary of President Richard Nixon’s visit to China and the 40th anniversary of the August 17 Communiqué. History matters. It made things the way they are today, and helps shape a better future when its value is appreciated.

A few days earlier I paid a visit to Dr. Kissinger. We reviewed how, with twists and turns, China and the U.S. came to common understanding 50 years ago and the wisdom reflected in that episode of history. Since day one of their engagement, China and the United States have been aware that each is dealing with a country very different from oneself. Yet, these differences were no obstacles to us breaking the ice and establishing diplomatic ties, no obstacles to us deepening cooperation based on common interests, still less to us making joint contributions to world peace and prosperity.

Looking ahead to the next fifty years, the sound and stable growth of China-U.S. relations still depends on whether we could put these differences in perspective and, on this basis, get on to pursue our respective and common interests.

Regarding the right way for China and the U.S. to get on with each other, President Xi Jinping has given a clear answer. That is mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. These three principles are an important conclusion informed by the evolution of China-U.S. relations over the past 50-odd years. They are also the right way for major countries to live with each other in this era.

Let me first talk about mutual respect.

Without respect, no trust can be built. Without trust, conflict would be a real danger and actual cooperation could not happen. This is an important lesson drawn from past exchanges between our two countries, and also a basic prerequisite for the bilateral ties to return to the right track.

In the Shanghai Communiqué issued 50 years ago, the two sides agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states. Fifty years on, this guiding principle is all the more relevant. We now can see clearly that China will not become another United States, and the U.S. cannot mould China to its liking. Neither side is able to take the other down. This means we need to respect each other’s choices.

Defining one’s own choice as democratic and the other’s as authoritarian, and seeing success as changing the other side in one’s own image are neither consistent with the facts, nor realistic.

China respects the development path chosen by the American people. We welcome an open and confident United States that enjoys growth and progress. The U.S. should also respect Chinese people’s choice of development path, i.e. socialism with Chinese characteristics.

This path is tried and tested by the Chinese people with a clear logic of history. In modern times, the Chinese people explored relentlessly for a path to save and revitalize the nation. Various models including Western systems were put into practice, but none of them worked when they failed to fit China’s realities. By adapting Marxism to the Chinese conditions and to the traditional Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China (CPC) successfully rallied the Chinese people and led them in a united endeavor to gain national independence and liberation. Eventually, China found a right path toward prosperity and strength.

This path has opened up bright prospects for China’s modernization. We have built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, eradicated absolute poverty for the first time in the country’s history, and in a span of a few decades, transformed China from a poor and weak nation into the world’s second largest economy. China has fed nearly 20 percent of the world’s population with nine percent of its arable land. It now has a middle-income group that exceeds 400 million. The 1.4 billion Chinese people moving toward modernization and common prosperity will make a miracle come true in the history of development.  

This path has brought true human rights and democracy to the Chinese people. The world’s largest social security network and compulsory education system have been set up. People’s all-round development is put front and center, and everyone stands a chance to reach one’s full potential. By integrating electoral democracy with consultative democracy, and procedural democracy with substantive democracy, we have advanced a whole-process people’s democracy that has won the people’s full support. Leading U.S. opinion polls show that the Chinese people’s approval rate of their government has stayed above 90 percent for several years running.  

That said, we are clear-eyed that much remains to be done in China’s development. China’s per capita GDP has just exceeded US$12,000, and trails 60-plus countries. It ranks below the 70th place on the Human Development Index. These require that we stay focused on our primary task—making development more balanced and adequate and meeting the people’s higher expectation for a better life. While relying on our own efforts in developing the country and the nation, we are also ready to pursue cooperation of mutual benefit with the U.S. and other countries, to foster a favorable external environment for China’s development.

The Chinese people, with a time-honored civilization of 5,000 years, are confident and self-reliant, and humble and inclusive. China will unswervingly follow its chosen path and direction, and will forge ahead steadily along this path toward greater success. China will continue to draw upon the valuable experience of other countries and achievements of all civilizations, embrace the world with open arms and open its door even wider.

Some worry that China will export its ideology and threaten the values of other countries. This is completely unnecessary. China has no history of preaching to or lecturing others, and has no intention to export its system or path today. As early as 2,500 years ago, by observing the inclusiveness reflected in the laws of the universe and nature, Chinese philosophers came to the conclusion that “Just as all living things grow in harmony without hurting one another, different ways may run forward without interfering with one another.” Living in our times, we should approach differences with a greater largeness of heart than our ancestors, accept differences with an attitude of mutual respect, and actively pursue the state of harmony without uniformity.     

Now let me move on to peaceful coexistence.

Partner or rival? Cooperation or confrontation? These are questions of fundamental importance in China-U.S. relations, and no catastrophic mistakes could be made. To hold the bottom line of peace, we must make the right choice.

I wish to tell you clearly that China chooses peace and commits to peaceful development. Our most basic expectation for China-U.S. relations is for the two countries to live with each other in peace.

As China develops, some people start to project China as a hypothetical enemy, and the so-called “threat inflation” ensues. This is typical excessive anxiety and is completely unnecessary.

Expansion, coercion and hegemony are never in the veins of the Chinese people. On the contrary, the Chinese believe in the ancient wisdom that “a warlike state will eventually perish”, and “a hegemonic state is doomed to fail.”   

Six hundred years ago, navigator Zheng He of China’s Ming Dynasty led the most powerful fleets of his times on seven expeditions across continents, earlier than Columbus’ discovery of the new continent. Yet instead of engaging in colonization, killing or robbing, the Chinese brought tea, silk and porcelain.

I once visited a history museum in Istanbul, a meeting place of Western and Eastern cultures. An exhibition hall on the left displayed relics from Turkey’s exchanges with China, mostly silk and porcelain, whereas a room on the right showcased antiques from its exchanges with the West, mainly swords, guns and armor. These exhibitions speak to vastly different stories in history. Equating the ability to develop with an intention for expansion, or predicting China based on the beaten path of traditional powers will both result in serious misjudgment.  

Today’s China is built on the heritage of ancient China. For 70-plus years since the founding of the People’s Republic, China has never provoked a conflict, occupied one inch of foreign soil, started a proxy war, or joined any military bloc. China has the best peace record among the world’s major countries. The CPC, China’s governing party, has incorporated peaceful development into its constitution, and China is the only major country that has codified peaceful development in the Constitution. China is committed to not seeking hegemony, expansion, coercion or sphere of influence, and it wants to live in peace with all other countries. This is undoubtedly a big contribution to global strategic stability.

For China and the U.S. to coexist in peace, we must follow the rules that both sides subscribe to. Bilaterally, they should be the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués and the important common understandings reached between leaders of the two countries, rather than imposing one’s domestic law on the other. At the international level, they should be the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter — the rules and order established with the tremendous cost borne by the world anti-fascist alliance and the enormous sacrifice made by the over 35 million Chinese casualties. As a founding member of the U.N. and the first country to sign the U.N. Charter, China has no reason, still less the need, to reinvent the wheel. China and the United States have a responsibility to jointly uphold the order and rules. If the United States’ repeated reference to a “rules-based international order” means the above-mentioned rules, China has no objection. But if it means something else on which no broad-based international consensus exists, then the U.S. has no right to impose it on others.

The biggest obstacle to peaceful coexistence between China and the United States is the Cold War mentality. Just as colonialism faded out in the 20th century, the Cold War mentality has long become an anachronism in the 21st century. Some in the U.S. try to take China down by repeating the containment tactic used on the former Soviet Union, and hope to encircle China through geopolitical maneuvering like the Indo-Pacific strategy. Such attempts will only prove futile, because China is not the former Soviet Union, and the world is not what it used to be. Only after waking up from the Cold-War dream can one view and handle China-U.S. relations in a cool-headed, rational and realistic way.

Third, on win-win cooperation.

No cooperation can be based on a win-lose format. Win-win cooperation is not only possible, but also a must. This is the true narrative of China-U.S. relations in the past half a century, and it should remain the goal we both pursue.

No two major countries have closer people-to-people contacts or more interconnected interests than China and the U.S. do. Before COVID-19 struck, there were more than 300 flights between our two countries every week and over five million mutual visits every year. We once had more than 100 dialogue and exchange mechanisms, 50 pairs of sister provinces/states, and 234 sister city relationships. Despite the pandemic and additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports, two-way trade last year topped US$750 billion, up by 28.7 percent year on year, and two-way investment reached US$240 billion. Sixty-six percent of American businesses in China reported plans to invest more in China. During this trip, I met with the representatives of the U.S. business community. They shared the view that China-U.S. cooperation has benefited people in both countries and the world and hoped to achieve greater growth in the Chinese market. These solid facts and figures fully demonstrate that the Chinese and American people want cooperation and our cooperation is driven by win-win outcomes.

For some time now, a few Americans have been saying that win-win cooperation is only a political slogan. We cannot agree with this. As the world’s largest developing and developed countries, China and the United States have a lot to offer each other. We enjoy broad room for cooperation in a wide range of areas covering economy and trade, energy, science and technology, education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges. We shoulder important responsibilities in addressing global issues like COVID-19, economic recovery, climate change, terrorism, proliferation and regional hotspots. We have also worked together and accomplished big things for the good of the world, including combating terrorism, tackling financial crises, fighting Ebola, and pushing for the Paris Agreement on climate change. An unfailing truth in China-U.S. interactions is that we both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Cooperation is our best choice.

Undeniably, China and the U.S. have competition in areas like economy and trade, and China does not fear such competition. However, we do not agree that China-U.S. relations should be simply defined by competition, because this is not the entirety or the mainstream of this relationship. At the same time, competition should have boundaries and, more importantly, be fair play. It should be conducted in compliance with widely recognized rules, and not be fixated on undercutting the development capability of others and denying them the legitimate rights and interests. We need healthy competition that brings out the best in each other, not vicious competition that aims at each other’s demise.

One case in point here is what happened to the Chinese company Huawei. Huawei is a 100 percent private enterprise, yet the U.S. has deployed government resources to suppress it around the world, and even warned countries not to use Huawei equipment or face consequences. This is clearly not fair competition. Ideology driven, the U.S. has overstretched the concept of national security, built “small yard, high fence”, clamored for decoupling and cutting supply chains, pushed for “friend-shoring”, conceived the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, and formed the Chip 4 Alliance. This is clearly not healthy competition. Such moves are not helpful to the U.S.’ own development. They will also disrupt global economic cooperation.

China has developed itself in the course of reform, opening up and integration into the world. China will not and cannot decouple from the rest of the world. In pursuing high quality development and fostering a new development paradigm, China needs closer connections with the world. By shortening its negative list on foreign investment and creating a more enabling business environment, China is providing its global partners with vast cooperation opportunities. And China welcomes greater success of American businesses in the Chinese market.

Based on equality and respect, China is willing to have more and better cooperation with the United States. Secretary of State Antony Blinken proposed, in his China policy speech, six areas for U.S.-China cooperation. In my meeting with Secretary Blinken in Bali, I also produced a list for our cooperation in eight areas. Together, we can make the list of cooperation longer and the pie of cooperation bigger. The Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and other public goods proposed by China are open to all parties, including the United States, and China also stands ready for discussions on U.S. initiatives, to bring about win-win outcomes for our two countries and the world at large.

For cooperation to be win-win, there needs to be necessary conditions and atmosphere. It won’t do if the U.S. undermines China’s core interests and the foundation for bilateral cooperation on the one hand, and on the other, expects China to cooperate unconditionally. Such logic simply doesn’t work. Meanwhile, I wish to emphasize that no matter how China-U.S. relations may evolve, China, as a responsible major country, will remain actively engaged in addressing the many global challenges, fulfill its responsibilities, and make its contribution. We hope the U.S. will do the same.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The Taiwan question is at the heart of China’s core interests; the one-China principle is the cornerstone of the political foundation for China-U.S. relations; the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués are the most crucial “guardrails” for our relations. As things stand, the Taiwan question is growing into the biggest risk in China-U.S. relations. Should it be mishandled, it is most likely to devastate our bilateral ties.

Before any discussion of the Taiwan question, the premise should be made clear: Taiwan is a part of China’s territory; it has never been a country. Effective administrative jurisdiction of Taiwan by the Chinese government dates back hundreds of years. In 1895, Japan launched an invasion against China and forced the then Qing government to cede control of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands (also known as Pescadores Islands). It was an episode of humiliation in the history of the Chinese nation; yet the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait never ceased their struggle against aggression and separation.

In 1943, the governments of China, the United States and the United Kingdom issued the Cairo Declaration, which stated in explicit terms that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, shall be restored to China. The 1945 Potsdam Declaration signed by the three countries reiterated that “the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out”. When Japan signed the Instrument of Surrender in September later that year, it pledged to “carry out the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in good faith”. The aforementioned legally-binding international instruments have fully restored Taiwan to China, both de jure and de facto.

It is evident that one-China has become part of the post-war international order, and the one-China principle, a universally recognized basic norm of international relations. The U.N. General Assembly Resolution 2758 adopted in 1971 not only resolved once and for all the representation of the whole of China, Taiwan included, within the United Nations, but also eliminated any room for creating “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” in the international community. Over the past five decades, the U.N. has always referred to Taiwan as “Taiwan, Province of China”: this is Taiwan’s only status in international law. Recognizing and adhering to one-China is also the political prerequisite for all the 181 countries in establishing diplomatic ties with China.

The U.S. also made unequivocal commitment of recognizing Taiwan as part of China. It is stated in black and white in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, the 1978 Communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations, and the August 17 Communiqué of 1982, that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China. Successive U.S. administrations have clearly reaffirmed their commitment to the one-China policy and several U.S. Presidents have stated their opposition to Taiwan “independence”. All these have been kept on record.

However, not long after China and the U.S. established diplomatic ties, the U.S. side went back on its word and passed the Taiwan Relations Act, followed by the so-called internal “Six Assurances”, constantly fudging and hollowing out the one-China principle. Both were unilateral moves by the U.S. side. They run counter to the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués. Hence, they are null and void from the very beginning, and the Chinese government has all along made clear its opposition.

Just as the U.S. will not allow Hawaii to be split away, China has the right to uphold the unification of the country as Taiwan is part of China. Since the Government of the People’s Republic of China is recognized as the sole legal government representing the whole of China, Taiwan should not be allowed to join any international organization with sovereign implications. If one recognizes the one-China principle, one should not engage in any official interactions with Taiwan. The logic here cannot be simpler.

Recently the U.S. has repeatedly referred to the “status quo in the Taiwan Strait”, and even accused China of “changing the status quo”. This is the very opposite of truth. To be frank, it is with U.S. interference and connivance that “Taiwan independence” forces have grown and expanded. They have kept making changes to the fundamental status quo that both sides of the Strait belong to one and the same China, and hence pose the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have jettisoned the 1992 Consensus which embodies the one-China principle, undermined the hard-earned prospect of peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, and been bent on pursuing “incremental independence”. They have publicly called for Taiwan independence in the party platform, dished out a new “two states theory”, pressed for “de-sinicization” on the island, and stoked antagonism and obstructed exchanges across the Strait. “Taiwan independence”, like a highly destructive “gray rhino” charging toward us, must be resolutely stopped.

Of all the major countries in the world, China is the only one that is yet to realize complete reunification. National reunification is the shared wish and aspiration of all the Chinese sons and daughters. It is also clearly stipulated in China’s Constitution. “Peaceful reunification and One country, Two systems” — this fundamental guideline best meets the overall interests of the Chinese nation including the Taiwan compatriots, and represents the most practicable and inclusive solution to addressing the difference in system between the mainland and Taiwan. Such a solution is peaceful, democratic, of goodwill and benefits both sides.

Although the two sides of the Taiwan Strait practise different systems, it is not an obstacle to reunification, still less an excuse for secession. We have always worked with the greatest sincerity and effort to pursue peaceful reunification. But, we will never tolerate any activity aimed at secession. We reserve the option of taking all necessary measures. This position is designed to forestall actions that violate the Anti-Secession Law; it in no way targets the fellow Chinese in Taiwan. Checking separatist activities for “Taiwan independence”, upholding territorial integrity and safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait is a sacred right that China exercises in accordance with domestic and international law.

The Taiwan question arose as a result of weakness and chaos in the nation, and it will be resolved as national rejuvenation becomes a reality. Reunification is the trend of history and the aspiration of the people. The U.S. should choose to stand on the right side of history.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In less than a month, the Communist Party of China will convene its 20th National Congress to draw a well-conceived blueprint for China’s development in the next five years and beyond. Since its founding, the CPC has taken happiness of the people and rejuvenation of the nation as its mission, and has also worked to advance progress of humanity and greater good for the world. Keeping to this founding aspiration, we will stand by the common values of humanity of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, and work with people in all countries to jointly advance the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

President Xi Jinping noted that, “The most important event in international relations over the past 50 years was the reopening and development of China-U.S. relations, which has benefited the two countries and the whole world. The most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the U.S. to find the right way to get along.” It is our hope that China and the U.S. will draw on past experience to find inspiration for the present, and gain strength for going forward. Together, let us explore a way to a China-U.S. relationship for the new era and create a better future for both of our countries!

Thank you.",China
110922,Director-General of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Yang Tao Lodges Solemn Representations with the US Side on Cyberattacks and Theft against Chinese University,"On September 8, 2022, Director-General of the Department of North American and Oceanian Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Yang Tao lodged solemn representations with the US Embassy in China on US cyberattacks and theft against China's Northwestern Polytechnical University.

Yang Tao pointed out that China’s National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center and cybersecurity company 360 recently released investigation reports respectively, exposing the cyberattacks conducted by an office under the US National Security Agency against China's Northwestern Polytechnical University. The relevant facts are clear, and the evidence is strong and compelling. Yang stressed that this is not the first time the US government has carried out such attacks to steal sensitive information from Chinese institutions, which has seriously infringed on the technical secrets of relevant Chinese institutions, and gravely undermined the information security of China's critical infrastructure, institutions and individuals. The US must stop such acts immediately.",China
090822,Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu on Pelosi’s Visit to Taiwan,"On 9 August 2022, Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu took questions from China Central Television and China Global Television Network on Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.

Q1. Over the past few days, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan has caused strong public outrage in China. What’s your take on this?

Ma: This is just a political farce, and a dangerous, malicious provocation. Speaker Pelosi made this provocative visit in disregard of China’s warning. The visit infringed on China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; violated the one-China principle and provisions in the three China-US joint communiqués; affected the political foundation of China-US relations; and undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is unacceptable to the Chinese people. China has every reason to respond with countermeasures. The incident is also a lesson, revealing to the world US motives to contain China with Taiwan and the intention of the Taiwan authorities to seek American support for independence. In its aftermath, the one-China consensus of the international community emerged stronger, and the US attempt to play the “Taiwan card” and contain China proved more unpopular and futile.

Q2. The US claims that there is no change to its one-China policy and that Pelosi’s visit does not violate the one-China policy. How would you respond to that?

Ma: The one-China principle is the consensus of the international community. It is also the political foundation on which China develops relations with other countries. It is a red line that must not be crossed. What does one China mean? There can only be one answer. That is, there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. This is a basic norm of international relations confirmed by UNGA Resolution 2758. It is a commitment made by the US in the three China-US joint communiqués. The principle, written down in black and white, is crystal clear. There is no room for ambiguity or arbitrary interpretation.

The US claims that there is no change in its one-China policy. But in fact, it has been undermining the one-China principle over the years. It has put into its one-China policy some unilateral stuff, including the “Taiwan Relations Act” and the “Six Assurances”. This is against international law. China never accepts it, and is always opposed to it.

The US also claims that Pelosi’s visit does not violate the one-China policy. The three joint communiqués provide that the US can only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial relations with Taiwan. The executive, legislative and judicial branches are all part of the US Government. Pelosi is the number three figure in the US Government. During her stay in Taiwan, she was speaking on behalf of the US from the beginning to the end. Even she herself admits that it is an official visit. If this is not official engagement, then what is it?

Q3. The US claims that the change to the status quo that’s prevailed with regard to Taiwan for more than 40 years is coming from Beijing, not from the US. What is your view on this?

Ma: So what is the status quo of the Taiwan Strait? The status quo is that both sides of the Strait belong to one and the same China, Taiwan is part of China, and neither China’s sovereignty nor its territorial integrity is ever divided. It is not China who is changing the status quo, but the US and the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. 

Over the years, the US has been colluding with the Taiwan authorities, and elevating its substantive relations with Taiwan. It has sold large amounts of weapons to Taiwan, helped it develop so-called “asymmetric capabilities”, and emboldened the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. If these are not changing the status quo, what are they?

Refusing to recognize the 1992 Consensus, the DPP authorities have insisted on pushing for “incremental independence”, and redoubled efforts to remove the Chinese identity of Taiwan. If these are not changing the status quo, what are they? 

China’s countermeasures are a necessary and legitimate response to the provocations by the US and the “Taiwan independence” forces. They are just and lawful.

Q4. The US says it will not seek and does not want a crisis, and China should take full responsibility for the current escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait. What is your take on this?

Ma: This is confounding black and white. The crisis is unilaterally provoked by the US. Despite China’s many representations, the US still allowed Pelosi to visit Taiwan. Faced with this, China has no choice but to fight back and defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. The responsibility and consequence of the current tensions have to be borne by the US and the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces.

Q5. The US claims that China’s military exercise and crossing of the median line of the Taiwan Strait are overreaction that has escalated the situation and threatened regional peace and stability. What is your take?

Ma: It is the US that is threatening peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is part of China’s territory. There is no such thing as a median line in the Strait. The Chinese armed forces conduct military exercises in waters off China’s Taiwan island to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity of China. Our measures are open and proportionate. They are in line with both domestic law and international law and practices. They are beyond reproach.

The US and its allies often come to the adjacent waters of China, flexing muscles and stirring up troubles. They conduct up to a hundred military exercises each year. They, instead of someone else, are the ones that overreact and escalate the situation.

Q6. The US claims that China’s decision to suspend cooperation with the US in multiple areas does not punish Washington but the whole world. What is you comment?

Ma: The US cannot represent the whole world. China has warned the US well in advance that should Pelosi visit Taiwan, it would cause a crisis and major disruptions to China-US exchange and cooperation. Unfortunately, the US side ignored that, and went ahead with the visit. The Taiwan question is at the very heart of China’s core interests. The United States, while undermining China’s core interests, is asking for China’s cooperation where they need it. What kind of logic is this? China’s decision to cancel or suspend cooperation in some areas does not come without warning. We say what we mean and mean what we say. There is no reason why the US should feel surprised or upset.

Let me stress this: as a responsible major country, China will, as always, take an active part in international cooperation on climate change and other matters. We make our own contribution to the tackling of global challenges. What the US should do is to fulfill its international responsibilities and obligations. It should stop making excuses for its own mistakes. 

Q7. Some in the US compare China’s military drills in the Taiwan Strait to Russia’s “invasion of Ukraine”, which they claim will be denounced by the international community. What is your comment on that?

Ma: Such a claim is ill-intentioned. The Taiwan question is entirely China’s internal affair. It is different from the Ukraine issue. The US always stokes tension and provokes troubles. Preliminary numbers show that between the end of the Second World War and 2001, there were 248 armed conflicts in 153 regions across the world, among which 201 were initiated by the US. Since 2001, wars and military operations launched by the US have resulted in over 800,000 deaths and tens of millions displaced from home. After starting so many wars and killing so many civilians to preserve its hegemony, the US is now creating troubles in the Taiwan Strait. How could we possibly allow this to happen?

Q8. A few days ago, the G7 foreign ministers issued a statement regarding Taiwan with negative language, expressing so-called “concern” over China’s actions. Meanwhile we see an increasing number of countries and international organizations speaking out in support of China’s justified measures. What is your take?

Ma: More than 170 countries and many international organizations have spoken up for what is right, reaffirming their commitment to the one-China principle and expressing support for China in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Both the President of the UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary-General have stated that the UN will continue to adhere to UNGA Resolution 2758, the centerpiece of which is the one-China principle. Compared with over 170 countries, what do G7 think they are? Who cares what they say?

Q9. The US claims that if China continues to take more countermeasures, the US will be forced to respond, which may lead to a spiral of escalation. What is your view on what may happen next?

Ma: It has been proved time and again that the US is the biggest troublemaker of cross-Strait peace and regional stability. If the international community allows the US to do what it wants, the UN Charter will be just a sheet of paper, and the law of the jungle will prevail. In the end, it will be the developing countries that suffer.

The Chinese people are not to be misled by fallacies or scared by evils, and will never waver in defending our core interests. We want to stress to the US: do not act recklessly, and stop going further down on the doomed path. Give up the attempt to use Taiwan to contain China, play no games but return to the one-China principle and the three joint communiqués, and do right things and take concrete steps to facilitate the steady development of China-US relations.",China
070822,Wang Yi: The U.S. Side Makes Mistakes on the Taiwan Question in Three Aspects,"On August 7, 2022 local time, during his visit to Bangladesh, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in line with at the latest situation and pointing at the U.S.’ groundless arguments, stated that the U.S. side has made mistakes in three aspects regarding its House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's sneaky visit to China's Taiwan region.

First, the United States’ crudely  interfered in China's internal affairs. In disregard of China's repeated advice and warnings, the U.S. side insisted on arranging the third highest-ranking official of the U.S. government to pay the so-called ""visit"" to China's Taiwan region. Taiwan is part of China, not a part of the US territory. The U.S. side itself has made public commitments on this. The U.S. side's act is therefore a serious violation of China's sovereignty.

Second, the United States connived at and supported the ""Taiwan independence"" forces. Any country safeguards the national unity and not allow separatist forces to act recklessly. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the Taiwan region has included the pursuit of ""independence"" in its party program, and in recent years, it has tried every possible means to push for incremental ""Taiwan independence"" and create the false impression of ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan"". By publicly emboldening and siding with the separatist forces, the U.S. House speaker has made herself an enemy of the Chinese people.

Third, the United States deliberately sabotaged peace across the Taiwan Strait. The typical U.S. playbook is to first create a problem, and then use that problem to achieve its own strategic objective. Signs show that the United States, by orchestrating Pelosi's sneaky visit to Taiwan, is trying to repeat its old tricks. The U.S. side is taking the opportunity to beef up its military deployment in the region, which deserves high vigilance and a resolute boycott from all sides.

Wang Yi said that China's firm stance and its legitimate, reasonable, lawful, necessary, open and proportionate measures are aimed at safeguarding China's sacred sovereignty and territorial integrity, stopping the United States' attempt to use Taiwan  to contain China, shattering the Taiwan authorities' fantasy to pursue Taiwan independence by soliciting the support of the United States, and earnestly safeguarding peace across the Taiwan Strait and regional stability.

Wang Yi stressed that the principle of non-interference in internal affairs is the ""golden rule"" for state-to-state relations and the ""magic tool"" for developing countries to safeguard their sovereignty and security. We appreciate those countries for their understanding and support for China's position. As unilateral bullying acts happen from time to time in today's world, the international community should reach an even clearer consensus and speak even louder, so as to jointly uphold the basic norms governing international relations and international law, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of all developing countries.",China
060822,Wang Yi Elaborates on China's Solemn Position on the South China Sea Issue,"On August 5, 2022 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the 12th East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Phnom Penh, during which he expounded on China's position and refuted the so-called “concerns” expressed by the United States.

Wang Yi said China's position and claims on the South China Sea are supported by solid historical and legal basis. China has never changed the basis nor the scope of its claims,let alone make excessive claims. China and ASEAN countries are committed to properly handling differences through bilateral consultation and negotiation in accordance with the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). Over the years, China and ASEAN countries have worked together to maintain the overall stability in the South China Sea, providing a stable development environment for their respective development and prosperity.

Wang Yi noted that at present, the biggest risk to peace and stability in the South China Sea is precisely the inappropriate intervention and frequent interference by major countries outside the region. For a long time, the United States had not raised any objection to China's claims of sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea, and said that it did not take a position on the sovereignty issue of the islands and reefs in the South China Sea. Now, it has turned to a total negation of China's position and claims. This is untenable in logic, law and justice terms. Where is the credibility of a major country if it changes its established policies at will according to its own political needs? How can it win the trust of others in the future? In recent years, more and more US warships and aircraft have frequently appeared in the South China Sea and the airspace over it. China and the littoral states of the South China Sea cannot help but ask: what on earth is the United States up to? Non-regional countries should abide by their duties and earnestly respect the efforts made by countries in the region to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea.

Wang Yi said, China and ASEAN countries are speeding up consultation on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and will work together to upgrade the DOC and arrive at regional rules that are effective and have real  practical significance.",China
030822,The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Summons U.S. Ambassador to China to Lodge Stern Representations and Strong Protests against Nancy Pelosi's Visit to China's Taiwan,"On the late night of August 2, 2022, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng was instructed to summon U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns for an emergency meeting, and lodged, on behalf of the Chinese government, stern representations and strong protests with the U.S. side against U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to China's Taiwan region.

Xie Feng said Pelosi’s action in defiance of  the universal condemnation is a deliberate provocation and a playing with fire. It is a serious violation of the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués. It has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and seriously infringes on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It gravely undermines peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and sends a seriously wrong signal to the separatist forces for ""Taiwan independence"". The move is extremely egregious in nature and will have extremely serious consequences. China will not sit idly by.

The U.S. government must be held accountable. For quite some time, the United States has said one thing but done the opposite, constantly distorted, altered, obscured and hollowed out the one-China principle in an attempt to cross the red line and make ""breakthroughs"", and played the ""Taiwan card"" by hook or by crook. The U.S. even went further to delete such key expressions as ""Taiwan is a part of China"" from the its State Department website, put Taiwan in its so-called ""Indo-Pacific strategy"", blatantly upgrade its ties with Taiwan, increase arms sales to the Taiwan region, openly clamor for helping Taiwan improve ""asymmetric military capability"" and support separatist activities for ""Taiwan independence"".

Instead of restraining Pelosi's willful behavior and stopping her retrogressive and perverse acts, the U.S. government has connived at  her having her own way, which escalated tensions across the Taiwan Strait and seriously undermined China-U.S. relations.

Xie Feng pointed out that the U.S. side must pay the price for its wrongdoings. China will take necessary actions and respond with firm countermeasures. We mean what we say. Anyone who attempts to seek political gains by manipulating the Taiwan question will go nowhere. Anyone who harbors the illusion of gaining political legacy by playing the ""Taiwan card"" will be nailed to the historical pillar of ignominy. The United States should immediately correct its mistakes and take credible measures to undo the adverse impact of Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. The U.S. must not go further down the wrong path, escalating tensions and making the situation across the Taiwan Strait and China-U.S. relations irreparable.

The Chinese side once again urges the United States to stop its dangerous moves before it's too late, stop stirring up troubles on the Taiwan question, stop conniving at and abetting ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces, stop playing the ""Taiwan card"" in any form and using Taiwan to contain China, and stop meddling on Taiwan and interfering in China's internal affairs. The United States must take concrete actions to strictly observe the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, deliver on the ""five noes"" commitment made by the U.S. leadership (i.e. not seek a ""new Cold War""; not seek to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not against China; not support ""Taiwan independence""; not look for conflict with China), and not go further down the wrong and dangerous path.

Xie Feng stressed that the trend of the times cannot be reversed, and the will of the people  is not to be defied. Those who play with fire will perish by it. Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. The Chinese people will not be scared by evils, intimidated by pressure, nor misled by fallacies. In the minds of the Chinese people, nothing is more sacred than protecting China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and nothing is more important than safeguarding national unity and realizing national reunification. No country, no forces and no individual should ever underestimate the firm resolve, strong will and great capability of the Chinese government and people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to achieve national reunification and rejuvenation.",China
030822,Wang Yi: The Irreversible Historical Trend of Taiwan’s Return to the Motherland Cannot Be Changed,"On August 3, 2022 local time, on the sidelines of the series of foreign ministers’ meetings on East Asia cooperation and his visit to Cambodia, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to reporters and elaborated on China’s solemn position on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to China’s Taiwan region.



Wang Yi stressed that this is an out-and-out farce. The U.S. is playing the dirty tricks to encroach upon China’s sovereignty under the guise of “democracy”, and separatist forces for “Taiwan independence” like Tsai Ing-wen are hanging on to the U.S. coattails, turning their back on the just cause of the Chinese nation. However, these perverse actions cannot in any way change the prevailing international consensus on the one-China principle, nor can they change the irreversible historical trend of Taiwan’s return to the motherland. Those who play with fire will not come to a good end. Those who offend China will surely be punished.",China
030822,Chinese FM makes remarks on U.S. violation of China's sovereignty,"In disregard of China's solemn representations, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brazenly went ahead with her visit to China's Taiwan region, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said.

This move seriously violates the one-China principle, maliciously infringes on China's sovereignty and blatantly engages in political provocations, which has aroused strong indignation among the Chinese people and widespread opposition from the international community.

It proves once again that some U.S. politicians have become ""troublemakers"" of China-U.S. relations, and that the United States has become the ""biggest destroyer"" of peace across the Taiwan Strait and for regional stability.

The United States should not dream of obstructing China's reunification. Taiwan is a part of China. The complete reunification of China is the trend of the times and an inevitability of history. We will leave no room for the ""Taiwan independence"" forces and external interference.

No matter how the United States supports or connives at the ""Taiwan independence"" forces, it will be all in vain. The United States will only leave more ugly records of gross meddling in other countries' internal affairs in history. The Taiwan question arose when the country was weak and chaotic at the time, and will surely end with national rejuvenation.

The United States should not fantasize about undermining China's development and revitalization. China has found a correct development path in line with its own national conditions. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion Chinese people are striding towards the Chinese-style modernization.

We put the development of our country and nation on the basis of our own strength, and are willing to coexist peacefully and develop together with other countries. But we will never allow any country to undermine China's stability and development.

Provoking trouble on the Taiwan question in an attempt to delay China's development and undermine China's peaceful rise will be totally futile and will surely lead to total failure.

The United States should not fantasize about manipulating geopolitical games. Seeking peace, stability, development and win-win cooperation are the common aspirations of regional countries.

The introduction of the Taiwan question into the regional strategy by the United States, which inflates tensions and stokes confrontation, is against the trend of regional development and goes against the expectations of the people in the Asia-Pacific. This is very dangerous and stupid.

The one-China principle has become a basic norm governing international relations and an integral part of the post-Second World War international order.

What the United States should do is to immediately stop violating the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and stop playing the ""Taiwan card"" to disrupt the Asia-Pacific region.

The United States should not fantasize about distorting facts at will. The U.S. side claimed that China is escalating the situation, but the basic facts are that the United States first provoked China on the Taiwan question and blatantly violated China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The U.S. side claimed that there was a precedent of the U.S. House speaker visiting Taiwan. Yet the basic truth is that past mistakes cannot be used as an excuse to repeat them today.

The U.S. side claimed that it cannot restrain the Congress due to the separation of powers. But the basic norm of international law is that the United States must fulfill its international obligations, and key politicians should not misbehave.

It also claimed that China's pursuit of reunification is a ""threat"" to Taiwan, but the basic logic is that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and the Taiwan question is purely an internal affair of China. It is lawful and justified that China upholds territorial integrity and opposes secession.

I want to stress that the one-China principle is the key stabilizing force for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and the three China-U.S. joint communiques are the real ""guardrails"" for peaceful coexistence between China and the United States.

Clinging to the United States to seek ""independence"" is a dead end, and attempts to use the Taiwan question to contain China are doomed to failure.

In the face of the great cause of national reunification, the Chinese people have the gut not to be misled by fallacies or scared by evils, the ambition to never be intimidated or crushed, the determination to unite as one, and the ability to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and national dignity.",China
030822,Wang Yi: The U.S. Side's Act in Bad Faith on the Taiwan Question Will Only Further Bankrupt Its National Credibility,"On 2 August 2022 local time, after attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organization foreign minister's meeting and visiting Central Asia, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to reporters and staked out China's solemn position on the Taiwan question.

Wang Yi pointed out that the one-China principle is the overwhelming consensus of the international community, the political foundation for China's relations with other countries, the core of China's core interests, and a red line and bottom line that cannot be crossed. Some people in the United States keep challenging China's sovereignty on the Taiwan question, hollowing out the one-China policy, and even deliberately creating trouble in the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese people will never accept such moves, and the international community will also sniff at such unwarranted provocation.

Wang Yi said that, during his visit, the leaders of relevant countries clearly expressed their firm commitment to the one-China policy at the meetings and talks. They all believed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and opposed external interference in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan question. This once again shows that the one-China principle is the prevailing trend with overwhelming public support in the international community.

Wang Yi stressed that the U.S. side's act in bad faith on the Taiwan question is despicable and will only further bankrupt the United States' national credibility. Some U.S. politicians are flagrantly playing with fire on the Taiwan question for selfish gains and making themselves enemies of the 1.4 billion Chinese people. They will not come to a good end. The U.S. side has shown the world what a bully it is. This will only make people of all countries see more clearly that the United States is the biggest destroyer of peace today.",China
290722,President Xi Jinping Speaks with US President Joe Biden on the Phone,"On the evening of 28 July, President Xi Jinping spoke with US President Joe Biden on the phone at the request of the latter. The two Presidents had a candid communication and exchange on China-US relations and issues of interest.

President Xi pointed out that in the world today, the trends of turbulence and transformation are evolving, and deficits in development and security are looming large. Faced with a world of change and disorder, the international community and the people around the world expect China and the US to take the lead in upholding world peace and security and in promoting global development and prosperity. This is the responsibility of China and the US as two major countries.

President Xi underscored that to approach and define China-US relations in terms of strategic competition and view China as the primary rival and the most serious long-term challenge would be misperceiving China-US relations and misreading China’s development, and would mislead the people of the two countries and the international community. The two sides need to maintain communication at all levels and make good use of existing channels to promote bilateral cooperation. Recognizing the many challenges facing the global economy, President Xi underscored the need for China and the US to maintain communication on such important issues as coordinating macroeconomic policies, keeping global industrial and supply chains stable, and protecting global energy and food security. Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the US economy. They would only make the world economy more vulnerable. The two sides need to work for deescalation of regional hotspots, help rid the world of COVID-19 as early as possible, reduce the risk of stagflation and recession, and uphold the international system centering on the UN and the international order underpinned by international law.

President Xi elaborated on China’s principled position on the Taiwan question. President Xi highlighted that the historical ins and outs of the Taiwan question are crystal clear, and so are the fact and status quo that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China. The three Sino-US joint communiqués embody the political commitments made by the two sides, and the one-China principle is the political foundation for China-US relations. China firmly opposes separatist moves toward “Taiwan independence” and interference by external forces, and never allows any room for “Taiwan independence” forces in whatever form. The position of the Chinese government and people on the Taiwan question is consistent, and resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. The public opinion cannot be defied. Those who play with fire will perish by it. It is hoped that the US will be clear-eyed about this. The US should honor the one-China principle and implement the three joint communiqués both in word and in deed.

President Biden said that the world is at a critical moment. US-China cooperation benefits not only the two peoples but also people of all countries. The US hopes to keep an open line of communication with China to enhance mutual understanding and avoid misperception and miscalculation, and will work with China where the interests of the two countries align and, at the same time, properly manage differences. He reiterated that the one-China policy of the US has not changed and will not change, and that the US does not support “Taiwan independence”.

The two Presidents exchanged views on issues including the Ukraine crisis. President Xi reiterated China’s principled position.

Both Presidents viewed their call as candid and in-depth. They agreed to stay in touch and instructed the two teams to keep up communication and cooperation.",China

140622,Yang Jiechi Meets with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan,"On June 13, 2022 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi met with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Luxembourg. The two sides had candid, in-depth and constructive communication and exchanges on China-U.S. relations and other issues of common concern, and agreed to focus on following through on the consensus reached by the heads of state of the two countries to strengthen contact and dialogue, reduce misunderstanding and miscalculation, and properly manage differences. Both sides agree that it is necessary and beneficial to keep communication channels unimpeded.

Yang Jiechi pointed out, President Joe Biden has repeatedly said to President Xi Jinping that the United States does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the United States does not support ""Taiwan independence""; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China. China attaches great importance to this. However, for some time now, the United States has insisted on stepping up all-round containment and repression against China. Instead of solving the problems facing the United States, it has put China-U.S. Relations in a very difficult situation and greatly damaged bilateral exchanges and cooperation. This situation is not in the interests of China, the United States and the rest of the world.

Yang Jiechi said, China-U.S. relations stand at an important crossroads. The three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation put forward by President Xi Jinping are the right way for China and the United States to get along with each other. The three principles serve the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people and the common aspiration of the international community, and should be the fundamental guidance for the development of China-U.S. relations. China is ready to discuss ways and means to realize this vision with the United States. China firmly opposes the definition of China-U.S. relations by competition. The United States should put China in the right strategic perspective, make the right choice, and translate President Biden's remarks into concrete actions that the United States does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China's system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the United States does not support ""Taiwan Independence""; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China. The United States needs to work with China in the same direction to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state.

Yang Jiechi stressed that China's position on safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity is unequivocal and firm. China's internal affairs brook no interference from other countries. Any attempt to obstruct or undermine China's national reunification will be doomed to failure. The Taiwan question concerns the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and if it is not handled properly, it will have a subversive impact. This risk not only exists, but will continue to rise as the United States attempts to ""use the Taiwan question to contain China"" and the Taiwan authorities attempt to seek ""Taiwan independence"" by soliciting U.S. support. The United States should not have any miscalculation or illusion. It must abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three joint communiqués between China and the United States; it must prudently and properly handle questions related to Taiwan. Yang Jiechi also elaborated on China's solemn position on Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Xizang, the South China Sea, human rights, religion and other issues.

Yang Jiechi emphasized that the United States should have positive interactions with China and make joint efforts for the prosperity, stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region.

The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues such as the Ukraine issue and the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.",China
310522,"Wang Yi Delivers a Video Speech at Symposium on ""Dr. Kissinger and China-U.S. Relations""
","On May 31, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a video speech at the Symposium on "" Dr. Kissinger and China-U.S. Relations"" upon invitation.

Wang Yi appreciated the long-term care and support of friends from all walks of life in the United States, represented by Henry Kissinger, for the development of China-U.S. relations. He said that half a century ago, Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, President Richard Nixon, Dr. Henry Kissinger and other elder generation of Chinese and American leaders broke the ice of isolation and confrontation between the two countries with extraordinary foresight, political courage and diplomatic wisdom, and realized the ""handshake across the Pacific Ocean"" that shook the world, opening a new chapter in China-U.S. relations. Over the past 50 years, Dr. Kissinger has visited China nearly 100 times to promote successive U.S. administrations to pursue a positive policy towards China, and has been committed to developing China-U.S. relations into one of the most magnificent chapters in his diplomatic career.

Wang Yi said that building a world of connectivity, diversity, inclusiveness, security and shared benefits is a responsibility and obligation that China and the United States must undertake. Whether China and the United States can properly handle bilateral relations is the question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer. Touting that ""the engagement between China and the United States has failed"", playing up that ""dialogue is useless"" and claiming that ""win-win cooperation is just a political slogan"", these arguments do not respect history and are inconsistent with the facts.

Wang Yi pointed out that China-U.S. relations are encountering more and more challenges, the historical narrative of China-U.S. relations has been artificially distorted, and the development direction is in danger of being further led astray. If the United States continues to turn back the clock of history on the Taiwan question, it will fundamentally undermine peace across the Taiwan Straits and will eventually hurt itself. China-U.S. relations cannot continue to deteriorate. We must make the right choice. We need to correct our strategic perception and abandon the Cold War mentality. We need to consolidate the political foundation and properly manage differences. We need to move forward from the logic of competition and enhance exchanges and cooperation.

Wang Yi said that the current atmosphere of China-U.S. relations is much abnormal, and the high anxiety of the U.S. side is completely unnecessary. China's overriding task is to concentrate on developing itself and meet its people's aspirations for a better life. If the United States keeps defining its relations with China in terms of major power competition and sets its policy goal as ""I-win-you-lose"", it will only push China and the United States into confrontation and conflict and the world into division and turmoil.

Wang Yi said that Dr. Kissinger once said that we should have a ""diplomatic philosophy"" and not just take diplomacy as an ""administrative matter"". In an era of turbulence and transformation, mankind needs a new diplomatic philosophy of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. He hopes that people with insight from the United States will stop hesitating and take action to continuously inject positive energy into China-U.S. relations. He expects that people from all walks of life in China and the United States will no longer remain silent and actively speak up to bring new hopes to the people of the two countries.

The Symposium on "" Dr. Kissinger and China-U.S. Relations"" was held online by the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs on the occasion of former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's 99th birthday. The symposium reviewed Kissinger's active efforts to promote the development of China-U.S. relations and had discussions on China-U.S. relations.",China
280522,"Wang Yi: U.S. views on world, China, China-U.S. relations are seriously miscalibrated
","On 28 May 2022, in response to a question from a journalist on U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken’s policy speech, in which he said that China poses “the most serious long-term challenge to the international order” and that the United States will “invest, align, compete”, how will that affect the international landscape and China-U.S. relations, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that the U.S. views on the world, on China and on China-U.S. relations reflected in this policy speech are seriously miscalibrated.

State Councilor Wang said that we want to make clear to the U.S. side that this world is not the world depicted by the United States. The most pressing task facing the international community is to jointly safeguard the life and health of the people, advance global economic recovery, and uphold world peace and tranquility. That requires a sense of a community with a shared future, and real efforts to put the purposes and principles of the UN Charter into practice. In this context, President Xi Jinping has proposed Belt and Road cooperation, the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, which have all been widely welcomed and supported across the international community. In contrast, the United States sticks to U.S. centrism and exceptionalism, Cold War mentality, hegemonic logic and bloc politics. Such moves run counter to the trend of history, and will only lead to conflict, confrontation and division in the international community. The United States has, in effect, become a source of instability undermining the current international order and an obstacle in the pursuit of greater democracy in international relations.

We want to make clear to the U.S. side that China is not the country visualized by the United States. China’s development and rejuvenation is underpinned by clear historical logic and strong internal driving force. The modernization drive of 1.4 billion people is tremendous progress of the humanity, not a threat or challenge to the world. What we rely on is the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the unity, hard work and perseverance of the Chinese people, and the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our goal is open and above board: to deliver a better life for the people and make greater contributions to the world, not to replace or challenge anyone else. We are now advancing reform and opening-up and pursuing win-win cooperation at a higher level. Such efforts will lead to a better tomorrow for China, and make the world a better place.

We want to make clear to the U.S. side that the China-U.S. relationship is not the zero-sum game designed by the United States. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, whether China and the United States can handle the relationship well bears on the future of the world, and it is a question of the century to which the two countries must answer well. And when the U.S. side tries to provide its answer, it must be aware that unipolar hegemony has no support, bloc confrontation has no future, small yards with high fences mean seclusion and regression, and decoupling and supplies cut hurt the interests of all. Countries need to conduct fair competition, and China and the United States are no exception. Yet the competition should not be a vicious one. China stands ready for fair competition on who can run the country better and who can contribute more to the world. The Chinese people have the confidence and courage for that. We never recoil at blackmail or coercion, and will steadfastly safeguard China’s sovereignty, security and development interests. Suppression and containment will only make the Chinese people more united. The Chinese people have the character and conviction for that.

State Councilor Wang stressed that as China-U.S. relations stand at an important crossroads, the United States must make the right choice. Instead of digging its heels in on its “trichotomy” and “three-point approach” to China, it should focus its efforts on the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and find the right way of interaction between the two major countries of China and the United States in the new era.",China
190522,"Yang Jiechi Speaks with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at Request on the Phone
","On May 18, 2022, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi had a phone conversation with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the latter's request.

Yang Jiechi said, the two sides should earnestly implement the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden on China-U.S. relations. Recently, the two sides have held some dialogues in fields such as the two militaries, climate change, health and agriculture, which are beneficial, and the momentum of dialogue should be maintained. Meanwhile, it must be pointed out that for some time, the United States has been acting with a series of erroneous words and deeds that interfere in China's internal affairs and harm China's interests. China firmly opposes this and has responded forcefully. The United States should match its words with actions, translate its commitments into concrete policies and actions, work with the Chinese side in the same direction, properly manage differences, and do more constructive things to bring bilateral relations back to the right track of sound and steady development.

Yang Jiechi stressed, the Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive core issue in China-U.S. relations. The U.S. side has made it clear on many occasions that it pursues the one-China principle and does not support ""Taiwan independence"". However, recent U.S. actions on the Taiwan question are widely distant from its statements. If the U.S. side persists in playing the ""Taiwan card"" and goes further down the wrong path, it will surely put the situation in serious jeopardy. We urge the U.S. side to get a clear understanding of the situation, strictly honor its commitments and abide by the one-China principle and stipulations in the three China-U.S. joint communiqués. The Chinese side will take firm actions to safeguard its sovereignty and security interests. We live up to our words.

Yang Jiechi pointed out, seeking peace, cooperation and development is the general trend in the Asia-Pacific region and the common aspiration of the people. When it comes to relations with neighboring countries, China always acts on the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness, develops friendly relations, pursues mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, and shares weal and woe. Any act that undermines the fundamental and long-term interests of countries in the region out of selfish interests is short-lived and doomed to fail.

180522,Wang Yi Makes Clear the Position on the Negative Moves by Japan and the U.S. against China,"On May 18, 2022, during a virtual meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made clear the position on the negative moves by Japan and the United States against China.

Wang Yi pointed out, Japan will soon host the QUAD summit among the United States, Japan, India and Australia. What makes people pay attention to and be vigilant is that even before the U.S. leader embarks on his trip, the viewpoint that Japan and the United States join hands to confront China was already rampant, creating a foul atmosphere. Japan and the United States are allies, while China and Japan have concluded a treaty of peace and friendship. Bilateral cooperation between Japan and the United States should not provoke bloc confrontation, let alone harm China's sovereignty, security and development interests. China hopes that Japan will learn from historical lessons, bear in mind regional peace and stability and act prudently, rather than pull the chestnuts from the fire for others and take the wrong path of beggar-thy-neighbor.",China
090422,"Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Korean Peninsula Affairs Liu Xiaoming Visits Washington, DC","From 4 April to 7 April 2022, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Korean Peninsula Affairs Liu Xiaoming visited Washington, DC. He met respectively with Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman, Deputy Assistant to the President on the National Security Council, Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel J. Kritenbrink, and Special Representative for the DPRK Sung Kim to exchange views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

Liu Xiaoming elaborated on China’s principled position on the Korean Peninsula issue and underscored that given the current situation on the Peninsula, it is most imperative for relevant parties to remain cool-headed, exercise restraint and avoid taking actions that could escalate tensions. The UN Security Council should play a constructive role for the political settlement of the Peninsula issue. Any action it takes should be conducive to deescalation and dialogue, instead of adding fuel to the fire.

Liu Xiaoming also made clear China's position on the Taiwan question. He stated that the Taiwan question concerns China's core interests. If mishandled, it will cause a disruptive impact on China-US relations. The US side should honor its commitment to the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiqueswith real actions.

The US side stated that the US and China have shared interests in maintaining peace and stability on the Peninsula and realizing denuclearization of the Peninsula. The US is willing to strengthen communication and cooperation with China and jointly push forward the political settlement process of the Peninsula issue. There is no change in the US one-China policy.

During his visit, Liu Xiaoming also attended a roundtable with scholars from renowned US think tanks to share China’s views on the Peninsula situation.",China
080422,Wang Yi Makes Clear the Solemn Position on U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Upcoming Visit to Taiwan,"On April 7, 2022, when having a phone conversation with French President's Diplomatic Counselor Emmanuel Bonne, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made clear China's solemn position on media reports that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would visit Taiwan.

Wang Yi pointed out, the current international situation is increasingly turbulent. On the Ukraine issue, the United States stressed that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country should be respected; but on the Taiwan question, it openly tramples on the red line of the one-China principle. This is a blatant double standard. If the U.S. House Speaker, a political leader of the United States, deliberately visits Taiwan, it would be a malicious provocation against China's sovereignty and gross interference in China's internal affairs, and would send an extremely dangerous political signal to the outside world.  If the U.S. side insists on having its own way, China will surely make a firm response and all the consequences will be borne by the U.S. side.",China

The two sides exchanged views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

Liu Xiaoming underscored that China is committed to maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, to achieving denuclearization of the Peninsula, and to resolving the Peninsula issue through dialogue and consultation. China is concerned over the current situation and does not want to see escalation of tension or see any party take actions that aggravate tension. The situation on the Peninsula has come to what it is today for a reason, and the legitimate and reasonable concerns of the DPRK should be taken seriously and addressed. China will continue to work with relevant parties to push forward the process of political settlement of the Peninsula issue.

Sung Kim noted that the US has no hostile intent toward the DPRK, is committed to peacefully resolving the Peninsula issue through diplomacy and agrees with the “action for action” principle. The US side is willing to resume talks with the DPRK at an early date to discuss all concerns of the DPRK, including sanction relief.

At the meeting, the representatives of the four sides exchanged in-depth views on the current situation in Afghanistan and how to strengthen collaboration related to Afghanistan, and held a dialogue with Acting Minister of Mines and Petroleum of the Afghan Interim Government Sheikh Shahabuddin Delawar.

The four sides agreed that a peaceful and stable Afghanistan is in the common interests of the international community. Afghanistan should not become a place for geopolitical rivalry, but a platform for international cooperation. The four sides reiterated their firm support for the Afghan people and stressed that more humanitarian assistance will be provided to Afghanistan. All parties in Afghanistan are called on to realize national reconciliation through substantive dialogue and negotiation, and work for a broader, more inclusive and united political architecture in Afghanistan in the future. The four sides stressed that various terrorist forces entrenched in Afghanistan remain a threat to the security of the region, and called on relevant Afghan parties to take more visible measures to fulfill their counter-terrorism commitment and dismantle and eliminate all types of terrorist groups. All sides are encouraged to work together with Afghanistan through commercial and market-oriented means such as economic and trade investment, connectivity and infrastructure construction to improve the level of practical cooperation and help Afghanistan improve its capacity for self-reliant development and achieve economic independence.

The participants highly appreciated China's holding of a series of foreign ministers' meetings among neighboring countries of Afghanistan, including the Extended Troika Meeting on Afghan Issue, and fully recognized China's constructive role in Afghanistan-related issues. The representative of the Afghan Interim Government said that the Afghan side is committed to stabilizing the situation, delivering security to the people, developing the economy, improving people's livelihood, and actively promoting a full range of social undertakings, including education, and hopes that the outside world will continue to provide assistance for Afghanistan.

Wang Yi said that China, the United States, Russia and Pakistan are important stakeholders in the Afghan issue and also countries with important influence on Afghanistan. The four sides complement each other's strengths and forge synergy, which can accomplish many major events. Since the situation in Afghanistan has undergone major changes, the consultation mechanism has played a constructive role in achieving a smooth transition in Afghanistan. China appreciates this. Under the new circumstances, the four sides should adjust work direction, support Afghanistan's efforts to rebuild the country and improve people's livelihood, and promote Afghanistan to respond positively to the expectations of the international community. In particular, it should earnestly fulfill its commitments, completely cut ties with terrorist forces and dismantle and eliminate them, so as to create necessary conditions for Afghanistan's economic and social development.

Wang Yi put forward three-point hope for the work of the mechanism in the next step:

First, we should strengthen coordination. In the spirit of seeking common ground while shelving differences, we should expand consensus, properly handle differences and send a consistent positive signal to the outside world.

Second, we should be pragmatic. We should take a problem-oriented approach and strive for more practical measures. In particular, the United States should take practical action on unfreezing Afghanistan's overseas assets and lifting unreasonable sanctions.

Third, we should persevere in our efforts. We should maintain a pioneering spirit, actively explore solutions to difficult issues, and promote the China-U.S.-Russia Consultation Mechanism to play an effective role in Afghanistan's peace, reconstruction and people's well-being.

Special Envoy for Afghan Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Yue Xiaoyong, on behalf of special envoys and special representatives of the four countries, made a speech.

200322,"Wang Yi: China's Position is Objective and Fair, and on the Right Side of History","On the evening of March 19, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to the press in Tunxi, Anhui Province, introducing the video call between the heads of state of China and the United States on the Ukraine issue.

Wang Yi said that President Xi Jinping has clearly and comprehensively clarified China's position on the Ukraine issue and sent the most important message that China has always been a force for maintaining world peace. We always stand for peace and oppose war. This is not only rooted in China's historical and cultural tradition, but also the foreign policy China has always committed to. China will continue to make an independent judgment based on the merits of the matter itself and in an objective and fair manner. We will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and we will also oppose any groundless accusations and suspicion against China.

Wang Yi stressed that President Xi Jinping also put forward China's solution to the Ukraine crisis, which mainly includes two aspects. What is pressing now is for all parties to work together to promote dialogue and negotiation between the parties concerned, cease hostilities as soon as possible, and avoid civilian casualties, in particular, preventing a humanitarian crisis. An enduring solution is to reject the Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and truly build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for the region, so that long-term stability and security in the European continent can be achieved.

Wang Yi said, China's position is objective and fair, and consistent with the aspirations of most countries. Time will prove that China's position is on the right side of history.",China
190322,President Xi Jinping Has a Video Call with US President Joe Biden,"On the evening of 18 March, President Xi Jinping had a video call with US President Joe Biden at the request of the latter. The two Presidents had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-US relations, the situation in Ukraine, and other issues of mutual interest.



President Biden said that 50 years ago, the US and China made the important choice of issuing the Shanghai Communiqué. Fifty years on, the US-China relationship has once again come to a critical time. How this relationship develops will shape the world in the 21st century. Biden reiterated that the US does not seek a new Cold War with China; it does not aim to change China’s system; the revitalization of its alliances is not targeted at China; the US does not support “Taiwan independence”; and it has no intention to seek a conflict with China. The US is ready to have candid dialogue and closer cooperation with China, stay committed to the one-China policy, and effectively manage competition and disagreements to ensure the steady growth of the relationship. President Biden expressed readiness to stay in close touch with President Xi to set the direction for the US-China relationship.

President Xi noted the new major developments in the international landscape since their first virtual meeting last November. The prevailing trend of peace and development is facing serious challenges. The world is neither tranquil nor stable. As permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world’s two leading economies, China and the US must not only guide their relations forward along the right track, but also shoulder their share of international responsibilities and work for world peace and tranquility.

President Xi stressed that he and President Biden share the view that China and the US need to respect each other, coexist in peace and avoid confrontation, and that the two sides should increase communication and dialogue at all levels and in all fields. President Biden has just reiterated that the US does not seek to have a new Cold War with China, to change China’s system, or to revitalize alliances against China, and that the US does not support “Taiwan independence” or intend to seek a conflict with China. “I take these remarks very seriously,” said President Xi.

President Xi pointed out that the China-US relationship, instead of getting out of the predicament created by the previous US administration, has encountered a growing number of challenges. What’s worth noting in particular is that some people in the US have sent a wrong signal to “Taiwan independence” forces. This is very dangerous. Mishandling of the Taiwan question will have a disruptive impact on the bilateral ties. China hopes that the US will give due attention to this issue. The direct cause for the current situation in the China-US relationship is that some people on the US side have not followed through on the important common understanding reached by the two Presidents and have not acted on President Biden’s positive statements. The US has misperceived and miscalculated China’s strategic intention.

President Xi underscored that there have been and will continue to be differences between China and the US. What matters is to keep such differences under control. A steadily growing relationship is in the interest of both sides.

The two sides exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine.

President Biden expounded on the US position, and expressed readiness for communication with China to prevent the situation from exacerbating.

President Xi pointed out that China does not want to see the situation in Ukraine to come to this. China stands for peace and opposes war. This is embedded in China’s history and culture. China makes a conclusion independently based on the merits of each matter. China advocates upholding international law and universally recognized norms governing international relations. China adheres to the UN Charter and promotes the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. These are the major principles that underpin China’s approach to the Ukraine crisis. China has put forward a six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, and is ready to provide further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries. All sides need to jointly support Russia and Ukraine in having dialogue and negotiation that will produce results and lead to peace. The US and NATO should also have dialogue with Russia to address the crux of the Ukraine crisis and ease the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.

President Xi stressed that with the need to fight COVID-19 on the one hand and protect the economy and people’s livelihood on the other, things are already very difficult for countries around the world. As leaders of major countries, we need to think about how to properly address global hotspot issues and, more importantly, keep in mind global stability and the work and life of billions of people. Sweeping and indiscriminate sanctions would only make the people suffer. If further escalated, they could trigger serious crises in global economy and trade, finance, energy, food, and industrial and supply chains, crippling the already languishing world economy and causing irrevocable losses. The more complex the situation, the greater the need to remain cool-headed and rational. Whatever the circumstances, there is always a need for political courage to create space for peace and leave room for political settlement. As two Chinese sayings go, “It takes two hands to clap.” “He who tied the bell to the tiger must take it off.” It is imperative that the parties involved demonstrate political will and find a proper settlement in view of both immediate and long-term needs. Other parties can and should create conditions to that end. The pressing priority is to keep the dialogue and negotiation going, avoid civilian casualties, prevent a humanitarian crisis, and cease hostilities as soon as possible. An enduring solution would be for major countries to respect each other, reject the Cold War mentality, refrain from bloc confrontation, and build step by step a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for the region and for the world. China has been doing its best for peace and will continue to play a constructive role.

The two Presidents agreed that the video call is constructive. They directed their teams to promptly follow up and take concrete actions to put China-US relations back on the track of steady development, and make respective efforts for the proper settlement of the Ukraine crisis.

Ding Xuexiang, Liu He and Wang Yi were present at the call.",China

","On March 5, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the latter's request.

Wang Yi said, at present, the top priority in China-U.S. relations is still to advance and implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state in their virtual meeting. China expresses grave concern over the U.S. side's recent words and deeds that run counter to the above-mentioned goal. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the Taiwan question is China's internal affair. The U.S. side should return to the true meaning of the one-China principle, stop encouraging and supporting ""Taiwan independence"" moves, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and uphold the larger interests of China-U.S. relations with concrete actions.

The two sides exchanged views on the Ukraine issue.

Blinken briefed Wang Yi on the U.S. views and position on the current situation in Ukraine. Wang Yi said, the evolution of the situation in Ukraine up to now is not something China wants to see. The Ukraine issue is complicated, which not only concerns the basic norms governing international relations, but also is closely related to the security interests of various parties. Efforts should focus on not only solving the current crisis, but also maintaining long-term peace and stability in the region. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China always decides its position and policy based on the merits of the matter itself. China believes that the Ukraine crisis should be resolved in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. First, respect and safeguard all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. Second, stay committed to peacefully solving disputes through dialogue. We hope that the war will stop as soon as possible, the situation on the ground will be eased, the life and property safety of civilians will be effectively guaranteed, and a large-scale humanitarian crisis will be prevented.

Wang Yi pointed out, the Ukraine crisis can only be solved through dialogue and negotiations. China supports every effort conducive to easing the situation and seeking political settlement. China opposes any moves that fan the flame, add fuel to the flame and escalate the tensions rather than promote a diplomatic solution. China will continue to speak out and do its best for peace. We encourage direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Though talks may not go smoothly, the international community should continue to render collaboration and support until results and peace are achieved. We also encourage the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the European Union to engage in equal-footed dialogue with Russia, face up to the frictions and problems accumulated over the years, pay attention to the negative impact of NATO's continuous eastward expansion on Russia's security, and seek to build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism in accordance with the principle of indivisible security.

With the support of the Chinese people and the international community, we will certainly present a streamlined, safe and splendid Games, practice the Olympic motto of ""Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together"", and bring people across the world together for a shared future.

270122,Wang Yi Speaks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the Phone at Request,"On January 27, 2022, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the latter's request.

Wang Yi said, the most important task for China and the United States at present is to follow through on the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden during their virtual meeting last November. During the meeting, President Xi Jinping summarized the experience and lessons learned in the China-U.S. interactions over more than half a century and clearly put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, charting the course for the sound development of China-U.S. relations. President Biden responded positively, saying that the United States does not seek a ""new Cold War"", does not seek to change China's system, does not seek to act against China by revitalizing its alliances, does not support ""Taiwan independence"", and has no intention to have a conflict or confrontation with China, thus sending a positive message in contrast to the previous administration. However, what the world has seen is that there has been no substantive change in the keynote of the U.S. side's China policy and President Biden's stated position has not been fully implemented. The U.S. side is still sticking with erroneous words and deeds related to China, which have dealt a new blow to bilateral relations.

Wang Yi said, this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Shanghai Communiqué. The fact that neither China nor the United States has the intention to change the other is a prerequisite for the normalization of bilateral relations and should also serve as a guarantee for peaceful coexistence between China and the United States in the future. The post-pandemic world will face new situations and challenges, but competition between major countries is not the theme of the world, nor will it solve the problems faced by the United States and other countries. As the world's top two economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the United States should bear in mind the two peoples' fundamental interests, follow the trend of world development, and properly implement the important consensus between the two heads of state. Both sides must grasp the general direction of China-U.S. relations, live up to their commitments by concrete actions, expand the positive aspects of cooperation between the two countries, and control and manage differences in a constructive manner. Wang Yi stressed, pressure will only make the Chinese people more united, and confrontation will not stop China from becoming stronger. The burning issue is that the United States should stop interfering with the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, stop playing with fire on the Taiwan issue, and stop creating various anti-China ""small cliques"".

Blinken said that it is important for foreign ministers of the two countries to have regular communication, stressing that there is no change in President Biden's stated position during the meeting between the two heads of state. The United States and China have both overlapping interests and differences, and the United States is ready to manage and control differences in a responsible manner. The United States' one-China policy remains unchanged. The United States will cheer for its athletes participating in the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, and wishes the Chinese people a happy Spring Festival.

Blinken briefed Wang Yi on the U.S. position on the Ukrainian issue, among others. Wang Yi said, to solve the Ukrainian issue, it is still necessary to return to the new Minsk agreement. The new Minsk agreement, endorsed by the UN Security Council, is a basic political document recognized by all parties and should be implemented earnestly. China will support any effort that conforms to the direction and spirit of this agreement. At the same time, we call on all parties to remain calm and refrain from inflaming tensions or hyping up the crisis. Wang Yi stressed, the security of one country should not be at the expense of the security of others, and regional security should not be guaranteed by strengthening or even expanding military blocs. Today in the 21st century, all parties should completely abandon the Cold War mentality, and form a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism through negotiations, with Russia's legitimate security concerns being taken seriously and addressed.",China

Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu accepted a media interview and introduced the great significance of the joint statement, China's efforts and China's proposition on strengthening the global governance in the nuclear field.

Ma Zhaoxu said, at the beginning of the year, the five nuclear-weapon states, namely China, Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom and France, jointly issued the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapon States on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, stressing that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought and reiterating that none of the nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or any other state. This is the first time for the leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states to issue such a joint statement on the issue of nuclear weapons, which has demonstrated the political will of the five states to prevent a nuclear war, and given the common voice of maintaining global strategic stability and reducing the risk of nuclear conflicts.

Currently, the world is undergoing changes and the COVID-19 pandemic both unseen in a century, and the international strategic security field faces many major challenges. The joint statement issued by the leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states is conducive to enhancing mutual trust. Replacing competition among major countries with coordination and cooperation is also of positive significance to the building of major-country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development.

Ma Zhaoxu stressed that China has always been advocating the idea that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought"", and has been playing an effective leading role in promoting the five states to take joint actions. In the consultation process of the joint statement, China also pushed for the inclusion of such key content as reaffirming that none of our nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or any other state, which played an important role in reaching a positive and substantial statement among the five states.

Ma Zhaoxu said, the five nuclear-weapon states, as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and nuclear-weapon states designated by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, bear a common responsibility to prevent nuclear war and safeguard world peace. The five states should take the joint statement as a new starting point to enhance mutual trust, strengthen coordination, and play a positive role in building a world with lasting peace and universal security.

China has always followed a self-defensive nuclear strategy, pursued a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons, and kept its nuclear forces at the minimum level required to safeguard national security. This in itself is an important contribution to global strategic stability. China will continue to contribute its wisdom and solution to promote global nuclear governance, and stands ready to carry out cooperation with all peace-loving countries.",China
030122,JOINT STATEMENT Of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapon States On Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races,"The People’s Republic of China, the French Republic, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America consider the avoidance of war between Nuclear-Weapon States and the reduction of strategic risks as our foremost responsibilities.

We affirm that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. As nuclear use would have far-reaching consequences, we also affirm that nuclear weapons—for as long as they continue to exist—should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war. We believe strongly that the further spread of such weapons must be prevented.

We reaffirm the importance of addressing nuclear threats and emphasize the importance of preserving and complying with our bilateral and multilateral non-proliferation, disarmament, and arms control agreements and commitments. We remain committed to our Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) obligations, including our Article VI obligation “to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.”

We each intend to maintain and further strengthen our national measures to prevent unauthorized or unintended use of nuclear weapons. We reiterate the validity of our previous statements on de-targeting, reaffirming that none of our nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other State.

We underline our desire to work with all states to create a security environment more conducive to progress on disarmament with the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all. We intend to continue seeking bilateral and multilateral diplomatic approaches to avoid military confrontations, strengthen stability and predictability, increase mutual understanding and confidence, and prevent an arms race that would benefit none and endanger all. We are resolved to pursue constructive dialogue with mutual respect and acknowledgment of each other’s security interests and concerns.",China
201221,Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng Meets with People from the U.S. Business Community and Briefs on the Spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference,"On December 15, 2021, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng met with Covington & Burling LLP's representative, former Assistant U.S. Trade Representative, and former Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China Timothy Stratford, former U.S. Consul-General in Shanghai and Chongqing Sean Stein and others.

Xie Feng briefed on the virtual meeting between the two heads of state of China and the United States and articulated China's principled stance on the development of China-U.S. relations in the new era. Xie Feng specifically briefed on the spirit of the Central Economic Work Conference based on the open press release. He stressed that China will carry out prudent and effective macro policies, implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, and boost internal development drivers. In terms of micro policies, China will continue spurring the vitality of market players, strengthen intellectual property protection, solidify the spirit of contract, and provide a better environment for the investment and operation of enterprises from all countries, including the United States. China will promote the common development of various forms of ownership, foster an enabling environment for the development of the private sector, and protect the property rights and legitimate rights and interests of various market players according to law. China will also open wider to the outside world at a high level, apply national treatment to foreign-invested enterprises to attract more investment from multinational companies, and accelerate the implementation of major investment projects. Xie Feng hopes that people from the U.S. business community will continue their investment in China, share the dividend of China's reform and opening-up, move forward with China for common development, and act as a tie and a bridge between the two countries, making positive contributions to the sound and stable development of China-U.S. relations.

The U.S. side said that Vice Foreign Minister Mr. Xie's briefing on China-U.S. relations and the Central Economic Work Conference addressed their particular concerns. His in-depth and valuable briefing is easy to understand and remember. It boosted their confidence in China's deeper reform and wider opening-up and consolidated their determination to operate in China for the long term. They learned about China's resolute and principled stance on China-U.S. relations and felt China's sincerity and positive attitude from his remarks. Covington & Burling LLP will continue providing professional and effective legal services for Chinese enterprises and will extensively reach out to various communities from the two countries to act as a bridge and a tie for deeper understanding and trust and contribute their own strength to the promotion of U.S.-China dialogue and cooperation.",China

On behalf of the Chinese government and people, Xi Jinping expressed his deep sympathies and sincere condolences to the affected American people.",China
301121,Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng Holds a Virtual Dialogue with Representatives from the U.S. Business Community and States and Cities,"On November 30, 2021, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng held a virtual dialogue with representatives from the U.S. business community and states and cities in Beijing. American representatives from AmCham China, AmCham Shanghai, U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC), and the Council of American States in China attended the dialogue.

Xie Feng said, our meeting today cannot come at a more fitting time, right on the heels of two historic events, one in China, and the other between China and the United States. Both are good news and will have a direct impact on you.

Xie Feng said, the first major event is the successful conclusion of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee. The Central Committee adopted the Resolution on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century, which answers a question of fundamental importance: namely why the CPC succeeded in the past, and how it will continue to succeed in the future.

The Resolution is a proud scoreboard that reviews the CPC's major achievements and historical experience over the past century. It explains how the CPC has led a nation, once on the verge of collapse, to liberation and independence; how the CPC has led a country, once poor and weak, to become the world's second largest economy; and how the CPC has completed two miracles in a huge country, namely rapid economic growth and long-term social stability. In the meantime, China has developed the world's biggest systems of social security and universal education, and lifted 770 million people out of extreme poverty. The 1.4 billion Chinese people now live a moderately prosperous life. All these not only benefit each and every Chinese but also represent historic contributions to the world. These facts help to show that the CPC is one of the most successful political parties in the world, and socialism with Chinese characteristics is a most successful development path that fits China's conditions. The 10 points of experience summed up in the Resolution are the recipe for the CPC's success, and hold the key to the dynamism and continued success of China.

The Resolution is a future-oriented declaration that the CPC is leading the Chinese people on a new journey. The CPC is by no means complacent about what it has accomplished. The aspirations of our people for a better life is our mission. The CPC will not rest on its laurels. We will keep working hard and lead the Chinese people to build a modern socialist country in all respects and realize the Second Centenary Goal. We will ground our work in this new stage of development, apply the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm, and promote high-quality development. We need to both make the economic pie bigger and divide it fairly. We are encouraging those having got prosperous first to help others catch up and expanding the middle-income group, so as to steadily achieve common prosperity for all.

The Resolution is a sincere invitation to the world as China welcomes with open arms the U.S. and other countries to share in its development opportunities. The reform and opening-up was a crucial move in making China what it is today. As stressed by President Xi Jinping recently at the opening of the fourth China International Import Expo, we will not change our resolve to open wider at a high standard, and we will not change our determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world. China has introduced a series of additional policies to further open up its economy. The negative list for foreign investment has been shortened by two-thirds in four years; the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are essentially liberalized; foreign equity caps on insurance, securities, fund management and futures services have all been lifted. In the 2020 edition of the catalogue, the number of Chinese industries open to foreign investment grew by 12 percent. Last year, China became the largest destination of foreign capital flows - a vote of confidence in China's business environment and development prospects. China's door will only open wider and will never be closed. The world will benefit from the strengths of China's stability, system, market, production factors and human resources as more dividends are released.



Xie Feng pointed out, the second major event is the virtual meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden two weeks ago. It had great significance not only for China-U.S. relations, but also for international relations. In a good atmosphere, our Presidents had candid, in-depth and constructive discussions, and the meeting was extended several times to three and a half hours in total.

The meeting is great news for both China and the U.S. as well as the whole world. Both China and the U.S. are at a crucial stage of development, and the world is in a time of turbulence and change. Our two countries are like two giant ships battling high winds and rough waters. A presidential meeting on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance will help steer the course of China-U.S. relations. It is of great significance and will have a far-reaching impact. During the meeting, both Presidents underscored the importance of our bilateral relationship and their belief that we must get it right and never mess it up. Both expressed their opposition to a ""new Cold War"" or confrontation and conflict between China and the U.S. They sent a strong message to our two countries and the world that China-U.S. relations should and must return to the right track of sound and steady development. The meeting has raised international expectations and provided a palpable sense of stability and certainty for the world. Shortly after the meeting was concluded, stock markets rallied with an average 0.64 percent rise in China's three major stock exchanges and a 0.43 percent rise in the three major U.S. stocks indexes.

The meeting reflects China's sincerity and sense of responsibility in developing its relations with the U.S. With farsightedness and vision, President Xi Jinping put forward three principles for China-U.S. ties in the new era, namely mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. He also highlighted four priority areas. First, shouldering responsibilities as major countries and marshalling a global response to acute challenges. Second, acting in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit to promote exchanges at all levels and in all areas and generate more positives for China-U.S. relations. Third, managing differences and sensitive issues constructively to prevent China-U.S. relations from getting derailed or out of control. And fourth, strengthening coordination and cooperation on major international and regional issues and providing more global public goods.

The meeting generates important common understandings conducive to China-U.S. practical cooperation. The two sides agreed to maintain communication on macroeconomic policies, support world economic recovery and guard against economic and financial risks. The two sides also agreed to work together on global issues such as energy security, climate change and public health. This will help stabilize and improve the international economic environment and address what are dubbed ""gray rhinos"" and ""black swans"", high-impact events that are often neglected or dismissed. President Xi Jinping pointed out that our two countries enjoy common interests in a wide range of areas and should complement each other and make the pie bigger for China-U.S. cooperation. He highlighted the economy, energy, education, science, technology and environment as potential growth areas and opportunities for China-U.S. cooperation. The two sides agreed to fully harness the dialogue channels and mechanisms between our economic, trade and financial teams to advance practical cooperation and resolve specific issues. This will help anchor expectations and address each side's concerns. President Xi Jinping affirmed that China is fostering domestic and international economic circulations with greater scope and scale, and building a business environment that is more market-oriented, law-based and consistent with international standards. This is a reassuring statement to the U.S and the rest of the world.

Xie Feng stressed that the two major events are giving us more confidence about the future. I encourage you to act quickly, leverage your strengths, get a head start and become ""early birds"" in reaping benefits from China-U.S. cooperation.

First, I hope you will be participants in and contributors to China's opening-up at a higher level so as to achieve win-win and all-win outcomes. Among the over 70,000 American businesses in China, 97 percent are reaping profits. It is estimated that China will import 2.5 trillion U.S. dollars worth of goods and services annually in the coming 15 years. This will inject tremendous impetus into economic, trade and sub-national cooperation between our two countries. Recently, China and the U.S. released a joint declaration on enhanced climate actions on the sidelines of COP26. Green economy will be a new growth area in our cooperation. We have every reason to pursue mutually beneficial cooperation in PV technology, circular economy, energy-efficient buildings, low-carbon transportation and power batteries.

Second, I hope you will be pioneers and cheerleaders for stabilizing and promoting China-U.S. relations. China-U.S. economic cooperation and trade do not happen in a vacuum and are inevitably influenced by the broader relationship. As a Chinese proverb goes, ""When a tree flourishes, people can enjoy the cool of its shade."" When the overall atmosphere of China-U.S. relations is good, economic cooperation and trade will do better. When bilateral relations deteriorate, business communities can't expect to be unaffected and make money quietly. Over the past four decades and more, even when China-U.S. relations encountered difficulties, the China business reports released by AmCham China, AmCham Shanghai, USCBC and relevant U.S. states and cities presented the situation objectively, pointed out that China-U.S. business ties are mutually beneficial, and expressed confidence in and commitment to China-U.S. cooperation. We highly appreciate that. We hope you will continue to play a unique and important role, speak out for what is right, and encourage the U.S. administration to follow a sensible and pragmatic China policy and to stop waging trade war, industrial war or technology war and stop creating confrontation or conflict over values, ideology or geopolitics.

Third, I hope you will be carers and doers in advancing mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the U.S., and oppose the politicization of economic and trade issues. International trade rules are decided by countries through consultation and ought to be observed by all. They should not be misused, discarded or selectively implemented. Disrupting the rules may bring some benefits for the time being, but would eventually upset the cart and rattle markets, and it won't do any good to anybody. Be it decoupling, supply cutoff, ""a small yard surrounded by high fences"" or trying to form small supply chain blocs against China, they all violate the laws of the market, disrupt international division of labor, disturb global industrial and supply chains, and try to divide the world economy into two parallel systems. The business community will have to bear double costs, in which situation how could they enjoy efficiency or benefits? I hope that our friends in the business community can take a clear stand against politicizing economic and trade issues and abusing the concept of national security. I hope you can work on the Biden administration to lift the tariff hikes, stop suppressing and sanctioning Chinese businesses, and create a level playing field for Chinese and American businesses.

Fourth, I hope you will build bridges and ties of friendship between Chinese and American people, and help improve mutual understanding and trust. Amity between the people holds the key to good relations between countries. I hope you will spread the word on what you have seen, heard and felt here to the other side of the Pacific. No need for exaggerated praises. Just tell the truth, so that the average Americans can have a full and objective picture of the real China. Issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Xizang concern China's sovereignty, security and development, which are our core interests. They bear on the national sentiment of 1.4 billion Chinese people. For the Chinese side, there is simply no room for compromise. I hope you will use your influence to urge the U.S. administration to truly abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués and honor the true one-China policy, which should not be altered, distorted or negated. The Olympic Games are a celebration of our common humanity. The principle of political neutrality is enshrined in the Olympic Charter. Earlier this year, the International Olympic Committee has unanimously decided to add the word ""together"" to the Olympic motto, which now reads ""Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together"". Boycotting the Olympic Games for political reasons would harm the interests of athletes and go against the common aspiration of the international community. Beijing will host the Winter Olympics next February, and Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028. China and the United States need to support each other and jointly honor the Olympic spirit of solidarity, friendship, fair play and mutual understanding. In this regard, I count on positive contributions from the U.S. business community and states and cities.

The representatives from the U.S. business community and states and cities stated that the international community pays close attention to the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the virtual presidential meeting. The CPC successfully held the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and will lead China to greater prosperity. The virtual presidential meeting was of constructive significance. The two Presidents had full, in-depth and candid exchanges on a wide range of issues of common concern. The inspiring meeting will help both sides enhance cooperation and manage differences, and provide important guidance for the development of bilateral relations in the next stage. The U.S. business community agrees that economic and trade issues shall not be politicized and that tariff hikes go against the interest of both the U.S. and China. In the year, USCBC, together with nearly 30 business associations, wrote to the U.S. government to express their concerns with this regard. American states and cities welcome Chinese enterprises to invest and operate there. The U.S. business community and states and cities attach great importance to and are optimistic about the Chinese market, and believe the business environment in China continues to improve. They are very confident in the prospect of Chinese market. They will continue to set roots in Chinese market, apply themselves to cooperation with China, build bridges and ties of friendship between Chinese and American people, and make contributions to improving the U.S.-China relationship.",China
301121,"Seizing Opportunities to Maintain and Advance China-U.S.
Economic and Trade Cooperation and Sub-national Exchange","Friends from AmCham China, AmCham Shanghai, USCBC and CASIC,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It’s always a pleasure to talk to representatives from the U.S. business community and states and cities. With courage and foresight, you were among the first to come to China since reform and opening-up, or what we in China say “the first to taste the crab”. With commitment and resilience, you have taken firm root in China for decades. With resourcefulness and ingenuity, you have explored effective working modes such as virtual visits and “doorknocks” even during COVID. So let me first of all pay tribute to you for what you have done.

Our meeting today cannot come at a more fitting time, right on the heels of two historic events, one in China, and the other between China and the United States. Both are good news and will have a direct impact on you.

The first major event is the successful conclusion of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee.

This important plenum was held at the centenary of the CPC and a historic juncture where the Two Centenary Goals converge. The Central Committee adopted the Resolution on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century, which answers a question of fundamental importance: namely why the CPC succeeded in the past, and how it will continue to succeed in the future.

The Resolution is a proud scoreboard that reviews the CPC’s major achievements and historical experience over the past century.

It explains how the CPC has led a nation, once on the verge of collapse, to liberation and independence; how the CPC has led a country, once poor and weak, to become the world’s second largest economy; and how the CPC has completed two miracles in a huge country, namely rapid economic growth and long-term social stability.

In the meantime, China has developed the world’s biggest systems of social security and universal education, and lifted 770 million people out of extreme poverty. The 1.4 billion Chinese people now live a moderately prosperous life. All these not only benefit each and every Chinese but also represent historic contributions to the world.

These facts help to show that the CPC is one of the most successful political parties in the world, and socialism with Chinese characteristics is a most successful development path that fits China’s conditions. The 10 points of experience summed up in the Resolution are the recipe for the CPC’s success, and hold the key to the dynamism and continued success of China.     

The Resolution is a future-oriented declaration that the CPC is leading the Chinese people on a new journey.

The CPC is by no means complacent about what it has accomplished. China’s development is still uneven and inadequate. Our per capita GDP is only one sixth of that of the U.S.

The aspirations of our people for a better life is our mission. The CPC will not rest on its laurels. We will keep working hard and lead the Chinese people to build a modern socialist country in all respects and realize the Second Centenary Goal.

We will ground our work in this new stage of development, apply the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm, and promote high-quality development. We need to both make the economic pie bigger and divide it fairly. We are encouraging those having got prosperous first to help others catch up and expanding the middle-income group, so as to steadily achieve common prosperity for all.

The Resolution is a sincere invitation to the world as China welcomes with open arms the U.S. and other countries to share in its development opportunities.

The reform and opening-up was a crucial move in making China what it is today. As stressed by President Xi Jinping recently at the opening of the fourth China International Import Expo, we will not change our resolve to open wider at a high standard, and we will not change our determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world.

China has introduced a series of additional policies to further open up its economy. The negative list for foreign investment has been shortened by two-thirds in four years; the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are essentially liberalized; foreign equity caps on insurance, securities, fund management and futures services have all been lifted. Citigroup, BlackRock and J.P. Morgan are among the first American firms to benefit from these policies.

In the 2020 edition of the catalogue, the number of Chinese industries open to foreign investment grew by 12 percent. Economic reliefs in response to COVID have been applied to domestic and foreign firms alike.

As a Chinese proverb goes, “When spring has warmed the stream, ducks are the first to know.” Capital is most sensitive to economic conditions and “vote with its feet”. Last year, China became the largest destination of foreign capital flows — a vote of confidence in China’s business environment and development prospects. China’s door will only open wider and will never be closed. The world will benefit from the strengths of China’s stability, system, market, production factors and human resources as more dividends are released.

The second major event I referred to earlier is the virtual meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden.

The successful virtual meeting took place two weeks ago. It had great significance not only for China-U.S. relations, but also for international relations. In a good atmosphere, our Presidents had candid, in-depth and constructive discussions, and the meeting was extended several times to three and a half hours in total. It was a substantive and fruitful meeting.

The meeting augurs well for both China and the U.S., and the world at large.

Both China and the U.S. are at a crucial stage of development,and the world is in a time of turbulence and change. Our two countries are like two giant ships battling high winds and rough waters. A presidential meeting on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance will help steer the course of China-U.S. relations. It is of great significance and will have a far-reaching impact.

During the meeting, both Presidents underscored the importance of our bilateral relationship and their belief that we must get it right and never mess it up. Both expressed their opposition to a “new Cold War” or confrontation and conflict between China and the U.S. They sent a strong message to our two countries and the world that China-U.S. relations should and must return to the right track of sound and steady development.

The meeting has raised international expectations and provided a palpable sense of stability and certainty for the world. Shortly after the meeting was concluded, stock markets rallied with an average 0.64 percent rise in China’s three major stock exchanges and a 0.43 percent rise in the three major U.S. stocks indexes.

The meeting reflects China’s sincerity and sense of responsibility in developing its relations with the U.S.

With farsightedness and vision, President Xi Jinping put forward three principles for China-U.S. ties in the new era, namely mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. He also highlighted four priority areas. First, shouldering responsibilities as major countries and marshalling a global response to acute challenges. Second, acting in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit to promote exchanges at all levels and in all areas and generate more positives for China-U.S. relations. Third, managing differences and sensitive issues constructively to prevent China-U.S. relations from getting derailed or out of control. And fourth, strengthening coordination and cooperation on major international and regional issues and provide more global public goods.

The meeting generates important common understandings conducive to China-U.S. practical cooperation.

The two sides agreed to maintain communication on macroeconomic policies, support world economic recovery and guard against economic and financial risks. The two sides also agreed to work together on global issues such as energy security, climate change and public health. This will help stabilize and improve the international economic environment and address what are dubbed “gray rhinos” and “black swans”, high-impact events that are often neglected or dismissed.

President Xi Jinping pointed out that our two countries enjoy common interests in a wide range of areas and should complement each other and make the pie bigger for China-U.S. cooperation. He highlighted the economy, energy, education, science, technology and environment as potential growth areas and opportunities for China-U.S. cooperation.

The two sides agreed to fully harness the dialogue channels and mechanisms between our economic, trade and financial teams to advance practical cooperation and resolve specific issues. This will help anchor expectations and address each side’s concerns.

President Xi Jinping affirmed that China is fostering domestic and international economic circulations with greater scope and scale, and building a business environment that is more market-oriented, law-based and consistent with international standards. This is a reassuring statement to the U.S. and the rest of the world.

What is perhaps of immediate relevance for you is that President Xi Jinping announced China’s readiness to upgrade fast-track travel arrangements with the U.S.

The U.S. business community have raised difficulties in traveling to China amid the pandemic. We attach great importance to your concerns, and President Xi Jinping is personally committed to seeing the issue resolved. Of course, the fast-track arrangement will also include contingency plans such as “circuit-breaker” measures, which are aimed to ensure both effective COVID response and sound economic and social development, lower the risks of cross infection among travelers to China, and help American firms here operate in a safer, better protected and more sustainable way.

Friends, the Sixth Plenum and the virtual presidential meeting are giving us more confidence about the future.

I encourage you to act quickly, leverage your strengths, get a head start and become “early birds” in reaping benefits from China-U.S. cooperation.

First, I hope you will be participants in and contributors to China’s opening-up at a higher level so as to achieve win-win and all-win outcomes.

Fortune will smile on those who choose to work with China. Among the over 70,000 American businesses in China, 97 percent are reaping profits. It is estimated that China will import 2.5 trillion dollars worth of goods and services annually in the coming 15 years, its middle-income group will swell to 800 million by 2035, its airlines will need 8,700 new aircraft by 2040, and its green finance market will be worth 100 trillion yuan by 2060. All this will inject tremendous impetus into economic, trade and sub-national cooperation between our two countries.

Recently, China and the U.S. released a joint declaration on enhanced climate actions on the sidelines of COP26. Green economy will be a new growth area in our cooperation. We have every reason to pursue mutually beneficial cooperation in PV technology, circular economy, energy-efficient buildings, low-carbon transportation and power batteries.

Incidentally, maybe you’ve noticed that other players are also doing the best. In the first ten months of this year, the EU’s trade with China exceeded 670 billion dollars, roughly 50 billion dollars more than U.S. trade with China. Also in the first ten months of this year, the number of freight services between China and Europe has already surpassed the total of last year and it is still growing with a strong momentum. So I encourage our American friends to step up with eyes wide open, or you might miss the “express train” of China’s modernization.

Second, I hope you will be pioneers and cheerleaders for stabilizing and promoting China-U.S. relations.

China-U.S. economic cooperation and trade do not happen in a vacuum and are inevitably influenced by the broader relationship. As a Chinese proverb goes, “When a tree flourishes, people can enjoy the cool of its shade.” When the overall atmosphere of China-U.S. relations is good, economic cooperation and trade will do better. When bilateral relations deteriorate, business communities can’t expect to be unaffected and make money quietly.

It has come to my attention that over the past four decades and more, even when China-U.S. relations encountered difficulties, the China business reports released by AmCham China, AmCham Shanghai, USCBC and relevant U.S. states and cities presented the situation objectively, pointed out that China-U.S. business ties are mutually beneficial, and expressed confidence in and commitment to China-U.S. cooperation. We highly appreciate that, and we hope you will continue to play a unique and important role, speak out for what is right, and encourage the U.S. administration to follow a sensible and pragmatic China policy and to stop waging trade war, industrial war or technology war and stop creating confrontation or conflict over values, ideology or geopolitics.

Third, I hope you will be carers and doers in advancing mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the U.S., and oppose the politicization of economic and trade issues.

As an early comer, the United States used to be an advocate of globalization. I still remember in the early 2000s and before that, the United States went to great lengths to persuade China to join the WTO and lectured us about free trade and market economics. To be honest, when diving into the vast ocean of the global market, China had its fair share of choking and ran considerable risks. Fortunately, although we were a latecomer to the game, we overcame the obstacles.

If the early comer can’t accept the fact that the latecomer may do better than the early comer in some areas, and tries to change the rules of the game to hold the latecomer back, it would be most narrow-minded, not to mention unfair. International trade rules are decided by countries through consultation and ought to be observed by all. They should not be misused, discarded or selectively implemented. Disrupting the rules may bring some benefits for the time being, but would eventually upset the cart and rattle markets, and it won’t do any good to anybody.

The U.S. side used to be a strong advocate of the view that business is business. But these days, political correctness seems to trump everything in the U.S. It reminds me of a saying in China during the Cultural Revolution, “I’d rather have socialist wild grass than capitalist crop seedlings.” Be it decoupling, supply cutoff, “a small yard surrounded by high fences” or trying to form small supply chain blocs against China, they all violate the laws of the market, disrupt international division of labor, disturb global industrial and supply chains, and try to divide the world economy into two parallel systems. The business community will have to bear double costs, in which situation how could they enjoy efficiency or benefits?

I hope that our friends in the business community can take a clear stand against politicizing economic and trade issues and abusing the concept of national security. I hope you can work on the Biden administration to lift the tariff hikes, stop suppressing and sanctioning Chinese businesses, prevent the passage on Capitol Hill of the Innovation and Competition Act and other acts on China. It is important to create a level playing field for Chinese and American businesses to engage in healthy competition rather than vicious zero-sum games. We must help both sides grow rather than drag them all down.

Fourth, I hope you will build bridges and ties of friendship between Chinese and American people, and help improve mutual understanding and trust.

Amity between the people holds the key to good relations between countries. Working and living here, you all engage extensively with Chinese society and interact in depth with Chinese people. Among foreigners, you know China the best and should have the most say. I hope you will spread the word on what you have seen, heard and felt here to the other side of the Pacific. No need for exaggerated praises. Just tell the truth, so that the average Americans can have a full and objective picture of the real China.

I’m sure you are all aware that issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet concern China’s sovereignty, security and development, which are our core interests. They bear on the national sentiment of 1.4 billion Chinese people. For the Chinese side, there is simply no room for compromise. I hope you will use your influence to urge the U.S. administration to truly abide by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués and honor the true one-China policy, which should not be altered, distorted or negated.

The Olympic Games are a celebration of our common humanity. The principle of political neutrality is enshrined in the Olympic Charter. Earlier this year, the International Olympic Committee has unanimously decided to add the word “together” to the Olympic motto, which now reads “Faster, Higher, Stronger — Together”. Boycotting the Olympic Games for political reasons would harm the interests of athletes and go against the common aspiration of the international community. Beijing will host the Winter Olympics next February, and Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics in 2028. China and the United States need to support each other and jointly honor the Olympic spirit of solidarity, friendship, fair play and mutual understanding. In this regard, I count on positive contributions from the U.S. business community and states and cities.

Thank you.",China
161121,China-U.S. Presidential Meeting:Setting Direction and Providing Impetus for Bilateral Relations,"Q1:This is the first ever  virtual meeting between the Chinese and U.S. Presidents, and the two leaders had  quite a long discussion. Did the meeting achieve its objective?

A: On the morning of 16 November,  Chinese President Xi Jinping had a virtual meeting with U.S. President Joe  Biden. This is the first ever virtual meeting between the two heads of state in  the history of China-U.S. relations. It has great significance for both  China-U.S. bilateral ties and international relations. The meeting lasted for  three and a half hours, from 8:45 a.m. to around 12:25 p.m. Beijing time, longer  than scheduled. The two sides had an extensive exchange of views on the  strategic, overarching and fundamental issues in China-U.S. relations, on their  respective development agenda and domestic and foreign policies, and on  international and regional issues of mutual interest. It was a candid, in-depth,  constructive and fruitful meeting. Under the current circumstances, it is  crucial that the two Presidents take the helm for the China-U.S. relationship.  The meeting has chartered the course and provided impetus for China-U.S.  relations to develop going forward.

Q2:The meeting has  covered major strategic issues about the future of China-U.S. relations and  important issues of shared interest and concern. Could you tell us more details  about what has been discussed? Any consensus reached?

A: The meeting can be recapped by  a set of figures-3, 4, 2 and 1. To be specific, President Xi put forward  three principles and four priority areas for growing China-U.S.  relations; the two Presidents reached two principled common  understandings; President Xi Jinping worked on the U.S. side on  one important question.

On the three  principles. At the meeting, President Xi pointed out the right way for  China and the United States to get along in the new era: First, mutual  respect. The two sides need to respect each other's social systems and  development paths, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and  respect each other's right to development. They need to treat each other as  equals, keep differences under control, and seek common ground while reserving  differences. Second, peaceful coexistence. No conflict and no  confrontation is a line that both sides must hold. Third, win-win  cooperation. The interests of China and the United States are deeply  intertwined. The world is big enough for our two countries to develop  individually and collectively. The right thing to do is to choose mutual benefit  over zero-sum game or the I-win-you-lose approach.

On the four priority  areas. President Xi identified at the meeting four areas where China  and the United States should focus their efforts on:

First, shouldering  responsibilities of major countries and leading global response to outstanding  challenges. China-U.S. cooperation may not solve all problems, but few  problems can be solved without it. The global initiatives China has proposed are  open to the United States, and we hope the same is true for initiatives from the  United States.

Second, acting in the  spirit of equality and mutual benefit to move forward exchanges at all levels  and in all areas and generate more positive energy for China-U.S.  relations. The two Presidents have stayed in close contact through  meetings, letters and phone calls, chartering the course for bilateral  relations. The two countries, with broad common interests in a wide range of  areas including economy, energy, mil-to-mil, law-enforcement, education, science  and technology, cyber, environmental protection and sub-national cooperation,  may draw on what each other has to offer and make the cake bigger for China-U.S.  cooperation. Our two sides could fully harness the channels and mechanisms of  dialogue between our diplomatic and security, economy, trade and finance, and  climate change teams, in an effort to advance practical cooperation and resolve  specific issues.

Third, managing  differences and sensitive issues in a constructive way to prevent China-U.S.  relations from getting derailed or out of control. It is only natural  for our two countries to have differences. What matters is to manage differences  in a constructive manner and prevent them from getting magnified or escalated.  China stands firm in defending its sovereignty, security and development  interests. It is important that the United States handle the relevant issues  with prudence.

Fourth, strengthening  coordination and cooperation on major international and regional hotspot issues  to provide more public goods to the world. In a world that is still not  peaceful, China and the United States need to work together with the rest of the  international community to defend world peace, promote global development, and  safeguard a fair and equitable international order.

On the two principled  common understandings. Both Presidents underscored the importance of China-U.S.  relations. President Xi noted the importance of the China-U.S.  relationship to the two countries and, beyond the bilateral scope, to the whole  world. We have no alternative but to get it right, and we cannot mess it up. A  sound and steady China-U.S. relationship is required for advancing our two  countries' respective development and for safeguarding a peaceful and stable  international environment. Our two sides need to increase communication and  cooperation, each manage our domestic affairs well and, at the same time,  shoulder our share of international responsibilities, take China-U.S. relations  forward in a positive direction, and work together to advance the noble cause of  world peace and development. Doing so will advance the interests of our two  peoples and meet the expectation of the international community.

President Biden said that how  U.S.-China relations evolve has a profound impact not only on the two countries,  but also on the rest of the world. The two countries have a responsibility to  the world as well as to the two peoples. The two sides must not mess up the  relationship, and the United States has no objective to change China's system.  He noted the need for the two sides to respect each other, have peaceful  coexistence, enhance communication, reduce misunderstandings and handle  differences in a constructive way.

Both Presidents expressed  that their opposition to a ""new Cold War"" and that China and the United States  should not have conflict or confrontation. China rejects a ""new Cold  War"" in whatever forms. And President Biden has also made it clear at the UN  General Assembly that the United States would not seek a ""new Cold War"". All  countries, including U.S. allies, are unwilling to return to the old path of  Cold War or to choose sides between China and the United States. At the meeting,  President Xi said that drawing ideological lines or dividing the world into  different camps or rival groups will only make the world suffer. The U.S. side  needs to meet its word of not seeking a ""new Cold War"" with concrete actions,  and play a constructive and uniting role in the Asia-Pacific. President Biden  noted that the U.S. revitalization of its alliances is not anti-China, and that  the United States' objective is not to have a conflict with China. The immediate  priority is for the two sides to have candid, extensive and substantive  dialogues in this relationship, and make sure that competition between the two  countries is healthy and does not veer into conflict.

Q3: Could I assume that  the ""one important question"" you mentioned in the end must be the Taiwan  question? Tensions are rising again in the cross-Straits relations. This is a  matter of concern for every Chinese. On the Taiwan question, the United States  has repeatedly interfered in China's internal affairs and stepped on China's red  lines, much to the dislike of the Chinese people.

A: Promoting national  reunification and safeguarding territorial integrity is the shared will and firm  resolve of all Chinese people. The Taiwan question has always been the most  important and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations, and a fixed topic for  every discussion between our Presidents. At this meeting, President Xi Jinping  pointed out that the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. Joint  Communiqués are the political foundation of China-U.S. relationship. Successive  U.S. administrations have made clear commitments on this question. In the UN  General Assembly Resolution 2758 and the three joint communiqués, the true  status quo of the Taiwan question and what lies at the heart of one China have  been articulated in clear-cut terms, i.e. there is but one China in the world  and Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of  China is the sole legal government representing China.

Achieving China's complete  reunification is an aspiration shared by all sons and daughters of the Chinese  nation. We will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the  utmost sincerity and efforts. That said, should the separatist forces for Taiwan  independence make provocations, force our hands or even cross the red line, we  will be compelled to take resolute measures. On this question of China's  sovereignty and territorial integrity, there is no room for China to back down.

President Biden reiterated at the  meeting that the United States abides by the one-China policy and does not  support ""Taiwan independence"".

On the question of Taiwan, I have  a few more words to say. As you said, the Chinese people are very unhappy about  the recent wrongful words and actions by the U.S. side, which were attempts to  misrepresent and obscure the one-China policy. The Chinese government has made  serious representations to the U.S. side for multiple times. The meaning and  connotations of one China are clear, legally and politically. They are reflected  in the three joint communiqués and the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758,  which are official international agreements and documents with legal effect.  They should not be altered, distorted or negated. The UN General Assembly  Resolution 2758 has made it clear that ""the representatives of the Government of  the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to  the UN"". The Office of Legal Affairs of the UN Secretariat, in a number of legal  opinions following the resolution, has also confirmed that ""the United Nations  considers 'Taiwan' as a province of China with no separate status"", and the  ""'authorities' in 'Taipei' are not considered to enjoy any form of government  status"". The three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqués say in black and white that ""The  United States of America recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of  China as the sole legal Government of China, and acknowledges the Chinese  position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China"". The United  States should adhere to the official bilateral agreements reached with China and  resolutions adopted with overwhelming majority at the UN General Assembly,  respect the fact that most countries uphold and stand for the one-China  principle. The U.S. side is expected to change its course and take steps to win  the trust of the Chinese people as well as the international community.

Q4: The rest of the world  is very concerned about risk management in China-U.S. relations. The United  States has talked about risk management many times, stressing the need for  making the rules of the road or ""guardrails"" in the bilateral relationship. What  is China's view? The United States is frequently talking about competition with  China. What is China's response?

A: President Xi Jinping said that  China is willing to discuss with the U.S. side effective risk management on the  basis of mutual respect. The high levels of the two sides, and the departments  of foreign affairs and national defense, among others, need to keep and increase  communication. That said, it is important to have the resolve to prevent and  avert crises, and remove their root causes. That would bring fundamental  solutions.

As for competition, President Xi  Jinping pointed out that cooperation should be priortized. Cooperation may  invovle areas of competition, such as the economic field, but competition must  be fair and healthy, conducive to respective and common development.

Let me draw an analogy: putting  out fire is certainly important, but fire prevention is equally important. So,  inflammables and explosives shall be removed whenever they are spotted.

Importantly, whether it is making  rules for competition or installing guardrails for a relationship, it should be  done through consultation on equal footing, agreed and adhered to by both sides,  rather than one side imposing conditions or demands on the other.

Q5: Since the start of  this year, values have often been made an issue by the U.S. side, and a  ""Leaders' Summit for Democracy"" will be held before the end of this year. Did  the two sides talk about this summit during the meeting?

A: President Xi Jinping said at  the meeting that democracy is not a one-size-fits-all product that has only one  model or configuration for the whole world. Whether a country is democratic or  not should be judged by its own people. Dismissing forms of democracy that are  different from one's own is in itself undemocratic. We are willing to have  dialogues on human rights on the basis of mutual respect, but we oppose using  human rights to interfere in other countries' internal affairs. Hong Kong,  Xinjiang, Tibet and maritime issues concern China's sovereignty, territorial  integrity and core interests, and are close to the hearts of the Chinese people.  On these questions, China has no room to back down. The United States should  respect China's interests and concerns, and handle the relevant issues in a  prudent and proper way.

Let me also say that China  advocates peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are  common values of humanity. Democracy is not a slogan to be chanted, but requires  concrete actions. The key criteria is whether it benefits the people and has  people's support.

Q6: We know that both  Chinese and U.S. Presidents care a lot about climate change. Was this issue  covered at this virtual meeting?

A: Climate change is a common  concern of the international community, and an important area of China-U.S.  cooperation. At the meeting, President Xi Jinping recalled China-U.S.  cooperation that brought about the Paris Agreement on climate change. A few days  ago, the two sides issued their second joint declaration about climate change.  As both countries are transitioning to green and low carbon economy, climate  change can well become a new highlight of cooperation.

Needless to say, cooperation on  climate change is inseparable from the broader climate of China-U.S. relations,  and thus requires efforts from both sides to foster an enabling atmosphere.  Since last year, China has announced its goals of carbon peak and carbon  neutrality, and then its decision of not building new coal-fired power projects  abroad. This means that China will use the shortest time in history to realize  the world's biggest cut in carbon emission intensity, a task that will take  extraordinary efforts. China is still the biggest developing country in the  world. All countries need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities, and strike a balance between climate change response and  livelihood protection. What the world needs is less finger-pointing or blame  game, but more solidarity and cooperation. Promises matter, but actions matter  even more. Developed countries need to earnestly fulfill their historical  responsibilities and obligations, and maintain consistency in their policies.

Q7: COVID-19 is still  ravaging the world and the world economy is struggling to recover. Mankind faces  multiple crises. Did the two Presidents talk about possibilities of cooperation  to address the crises?

A: Emerging from the shadow of  the pandemic, achieving recovery and stability, and overcoming the various risks  and challenges are shared aspirations of the international community. President  Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions China's readiness to work with all  sides in the spirit of solidarity at trying times.

At the meeting, President Xi  pointed out that the pandemic once again proves that humanity lives in a  community wih a shared future. There is no higher priority than putting people's  lives first. Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapons for the  international community to defeat COVID-19. Response to epidemics must be based  on science. Politicizing health issues does no good but great harm. The pressing  priority in the global COVID response is to address the vaccine deficits and  close the vaccination gap.

At the early stage of the  pandemic, China suggested making COVID vaccines a global public good. Recently  we have raised a Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative. China is among  the first to offer vaccines to developing countries in need, delivering over 1.7  billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to the world. In the course of this  year, the vaccines we will provide to the international community may exceed two  billion doses. On top of its US$100 million donation to COVAX, China has  announced a donation of another 100 million doses of COVID vaccines to  developing countries within this year. And we will consider making additional  donations in light of the needs of developing countries, the least developed  ones in particular.

To get better prepared in the  future, China and the United States should advocate the establishment of a  cooperation mechanism for global public health and communicable disease  prevention and control, and step up prevention against communicable diseases  such as influenza. The two countries may also conduct exchanges and cooperation  in areas such as the monitoring of COVID pandemic, research on scientific  bottlenecks, disease prevention and treatment, and vaccination.

Q8: Did the two  Presidents discuss regional and international hot spot issues at the  meeting?

A: The two Presidents exchanged  views on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, the Iranian nuclear issue and  Afghanistan, among other regional and international issues of mutual interest.  President Xi pointed out that China and the United States need to uphold the  international system with the United Nations at its center, the international  order based on international law, and the basic norms governing international  relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. A  multilateralism without China-U.S. cooperation or the participation of either  would be incomplete and unrealistic.

I wish to stress here that China  is willing to enhance cooperation on the relevant issues on the basis of mutual  respect, equality and mutual benefit. China will continue to play a positive  role on the relevant issues and make its own efforts. At the same time, we call  upon the U.S. side to play a constructive role, actively respond to, take  seriously and address reasonable concerns of parties concerned, and shoulder its  due responsibilities and obligations.

Q9: You said that the two  Presidents also exchanged views on the domestic development agenda. In China, we  have just had the sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, a big  event that has drawn a lot of attention. Did the two Presidents talk about  this?

A: At the meeting, President Xi  shared with President Biden, in the context of the sixth Plenum, the major  accomplishments and historical experience of the CPC in the past 100 years.  President Xi said that over the past centenary, the CPC has kept to its founding  aspiration and mission, namely to strive for the happiness of the Chinese people  and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We have accomplished a lot in that  direction, and we will continue to do more. Our people's aspiration for a better  life is what the Party strives for. ""Serving the 1.4 billion Chinese people and  working with them for a better life is my great honor and a great  responsibility, and I shall put aside my own well-being and live up to people's  expectations,"" said President Xi. Our people's aspiration for a better life is  the biggest internal driver for China's development and an inevitable trend of  history. Any attempt to stop this historical trend will be rejected by the  Chinese people, and will by no means succeed.

President Xi also reiterated  China's unwavering determination to open wider at a high standard, to share  development opportunities with the rest of the world, and to make economic  globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. China is  talking about a new development paradigm for the purpose of expanding domestic  market, fostering a combination of domestic and international circulations with  greater scope and scale, and building a business environment that is more  market-oriented, law-based and up to international standard. All this will  provide a bigger market and greater opportunities to the United States and other  countries.

Q10: How will this  meeting shape the future of China-U.S. relations? Do both sides have any  arrangement for the two Presidents to meet in person sometime in  future?

A: This meeting, held at a  crucial moment, is an occasion for the two Presidents to once again set the  direction for this relationship and will have significant and far-reaching  impact for China-U.S. relations. President Xi and President Biden agreed to keep  in touch by multiple means. We are open to all forms of communication between  the two Presidents, including an in-person meeting. We will let things take  their natural course. What matters is to move in the same direction and foster a  favorable atmosphere for the meeting to generate good outcomes.

If the China-U.S. relationship  can not go back to what it was in the past, then it must move toward the future.  China has no illusion. But we have confidence, and will continue to stay the  course. We are open to all options that can take this relationship forward. That  said, we also have our principles, in short, the three principles put forward by  President Xi Jinping today: mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win  cooperation.

The China-U.S.relationship stands  at a crossroads. We hope that the United States will work with China, follow the  spirit of the two Presidents' meeting with concrete actions, maintain dialogue  and communication, strengthen exchanges and cooperation and manage differences  in a responsible way, so as to promote sound and stable development of  China-U.S. relationship.",China
161121,President Xi Jinping Had a Virtual Meeting with US President Joe Biden,"On the morning of 16 November, President Xi Jinping had a virtual meeting with US President Joe Biden. The two sides had thorough and in-depth communication and exchanges on issues of strategic, overarching and fundamental importance shaping the development of China-US relations and on important issues of mutual interest.

President Xi pointed out that both China and the US are at critical stages of development, and the “global village” of humanity faces multiple challenges. As the world’s two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the US need to increase communication and cooperation, each run their domestic affairs well and, at the same time, shoulder their share of international responsibilities, and work together to advance the noble cause of world peace and development. This is the shared desire of the people of the two countries and around the world, and the joint mission of Chinese and American leaders.

President Xi stressed that a sound and stable China-US relationship is required for advancing the two countries’ respective development and for safeguarding a peaceful and stable international environment, including finding effective responses to global challenges such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. China and the US should respect each other, coexist in peace, and pursue win-win cooperation. President Xi expressed his readiness to work with President Biden to build consensus and take active steps to move China-US relations forward in a positive direction. Doing so will advance the interests of the two peoples and meet the expectation of the international community.

President Xi pointed out that the most important event in international relations over the past 50 years was the reopening and development of China-US relations, which has benefited the two countries and the whole world. The most important event in international relations in the coming 50 years will be for China and the US to find the right way to get along. History is a fair judge. What a statesman does, be it right or wrong, be it an accomplishment or a failure, will all be recorded by history. It is hoped that President Biden will demonstrate political leadership and steer America’s China policy back on the track of reason and pragmatism.



President Xi highlighted that a review of the experience and lessons learned in growing China-US relations shows that for the two countries to get along in the new era, three principles must be followed. First, mutual respect. The two countries need to respect each other’s social systems and development paths, respect each other’s core interests and major concerns, and respect each other’s right to development. They need to treat each other as equals, keep differences under control, and seek common ground while reserving differences. Second, peaceful coexistence. No conflict and no confrontation is a line that both sides must hold. The US side has suggested coexistence between China and the US. One more word can be added to make it peaceful coexistence. Third, win-win cooperation. With their interests deeply intertwined, China and the US stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. The world is big enough for the two countries to develop individually and collectively. The right thing to do is to choose mutual benefit over zero-sum game or the I-win-you-lose approach.

President Xi identified four priority areas where China and the US should focus their efforts on.

First, shouldering responsibilities of major countries and leading global response to outstanding challenges. China-US cooperation may not solve all problems, but few problems can be solved without China-US cooperation. The global initiatives China has proposed are all open to the US. We hope the reverse is also true. Second, acting in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit to move forward exchanges at all levels and in all areas and generate more positive energy for China-US relations. President Xi expressed his readiness to stay in touch with President Biden through multiple means to set the direction and inject more momentum into bilateral relations. The two countries, with broad common interests in a wide range of areas including economy, energy, mil-to-mil, law-enforcement, education, science and technology, cyber, environmental protection and sub-national interactions, should complement each other to make the cake bigger for China-US cooperation. The two sides could fully harness the dialogue channels and mechanisms between their diplomatic and security, economic and financial, and climate change teams, in an effort to advance practical cooperation and resolve specific issues. Third, managing differences and sensitive issues in a constructive way to prevent China-US relations from getting derailed or out of control. It is only natural for the two countries to have differences. The key is to manage them constructively so that they don’t magnify or exacerbate. China will certainly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests. It is important that the US properly handle the relevant issues with prudence. Fourth, strengthening coordination and cooperation on major international and regional hotspot issues to provide more public goods to the world. The world is not tranquil. China and the US need to work together with the rest of the international community to defend world peace, promote global development, and safeguard a fair and equitable international order.

President Xi compared China and the US to two giant ships sailing in the ocean. It is important for the two sides to keep a steady hand on the tiller, so that the two giant ships will break waves and forge ahead together, without losing direction or speed, still less colliding with each other.



President Xi explained China’s development path and strategic intentions. The just concluded sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee took stock of the major achievements and historical experience of the CPC in the past 100 years. Over the past century, the CPC has kept to its founding aspiration and mission of striving for the happiness of the Chinese people and rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. A lot has been accomplished in this direction, but that is far from enough. More needs to be done. President Xi said that when he took office, he said publicly that the Chinese people’s aspiration for a better life is the goal to strive for. The Chinese people’s aspiration for a better life is the biggest internal driver for China’s development and an inevitable trend of history. Any attempt to stop this historical trend will be rejected by the Chinese people, and will by no means succeed. President Xi said that as China’s leader, serving the 1.4 billion Chinese people and working with them for a better life is a great challenge and a great responsibility. “I shall put aside my own well-being and live up to people’s expectations,” President Xi said.

President Xi pointed out that the Chinese people have always loved and valued peace. Aggression or hegemony is not in the blood of the Chinese nation. Since the founding of the People’s Republic, China has never started a single war or conflict, and has never taken one inch of land from other countries. China has no intention to sell its own development path around the world. On the contrary, China encourages all countries to find development paths tailored to their respective national conditions.

President Xi stressed that opening-up is a fundamental state policy and a hallmark of China. China will not change its determination to open up at a higher level. China will not change its determination to share development opportunities with the rest of the world. And China will not change its determination to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. The new development paradigm that China is working to establish is aimed at expanding domestic market, fostering both domestic and international circulations with greater scope and scale, and building a business environment that is more market-oriented, law-based and up to international standards. All this will provide a bigger market and more opportunities to other countries.

President Xi highlighted China’s commitment to peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity. Drawing ideological lines or dividing the world into different camps or rival groups will only make the world suffer. The bitter lessons of the Cold War are still fresh in memory. We hope that the US side can meet its word of not seeking a “new Cold War” with concrete actions.

President Xi stated China’s principled position on the Taiwan question. He noted the new wave of tensions across the Taiwan Strait, and ascribed the tensions to the repeated attempts by the Taiwan authorities to look for US support for their independence agenda as well as the intention of some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China. Such moves are extremely dangerous, just like playing with fire. Whoever plays with fire will get burnt. The one-China principle and the three China-US Joint Communiqués are the political foundation of China-US relations. Previous US administrations have all made clear commitments on this question. The true status quo of the Taiwan question and what lies at the heart of one China are as follows: there is but one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China, and the Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing China. Achieving China’s complete reunification is an aspiration shared by all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. We have patience and will strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and efforts. That said, should the separatist forces for Taiwan independence provoke us, force our hands or even cross the red line, we will be compelled to take resolute measures.

President Xi highlighted that civilizations are rich and diverse, and so is democracy. Democracy is not mass produced with a uniform model or configuration for countries around the world. Whether a country is democratic or not should be left to its own people to decide. Dismissing forms of democracy that are different from one’s own is in itself undemocratic. China is ready to have dialogues on human rights on the basis of mutual respect, but we oppose using human rights to meddle in other countries’ internal affairs.

President Xi pointed out that China and the US need to uphold the international system with the UN at its core, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. Multilateralism without China-US cooperation is incomplete.

On trade ties, President Xi described the China-US economic and trade relations as mutually beneficial in nature. Business is business. Economic and trade issues between the two countries should not be politicized. The two sides need to make the cake bigger for cooperation. China takes seriously the wishes of US business community to travel to China more easily, and has agreed to upgrade fast-track arrangement, which will further enhance economic and trade exchanges between China and the US and boost the recovery of the two economies. The US should stop abusing or overstretching the concept of national security to suppress Chinese businesses. It is imperative for China and the US to maintain communication on macroeconomic policies, support world economic recovery and guard against economic and financial risks. The US should be mindful of the spillover effects of its domestic macro policies, and adopt responsible macroeconomic policies.

On energy security, President Xi noted the need for China and the US to call on the international community to jointly protect global energy security, strengthen cooperation on natural gas and new energy, and work with other countries to keep global industrial and supply chains safe and stable.

On climate change, President Xi recalled China-US cooperation that helped bring about the Paris Agreement. He pointed out that, as both countries are transitioning to green and low-carbon economy, climate change can well become a new highlight of cooperation. President Xi reiterated his belief that clear water and green mountains are as valuable as gold and silver, and that we must protect the environment the way we protect our own eyes, and treat the environment the way we treat our own lives. Today, ecological conservation has become a household concept and social consensus in China. China will make the world’s biggest cut in carbon emission intensity in the shortest time frame in history, a task that will require extraordinary efforts. China means what it says. It only commits to what it can deliver, and never makes a promise it cannot keep. China is still the largest developing country in the world. The issue of unbalanced and inadequate development still stands out. All countries need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and strike a balance between addressing climate change and protecting livelihoods. What the world needs is less finger-pointing or blame game, but more solidarity and cooperation. Words matter, but actions matter even more. Developed countries need to earnestly fulfill their historical responsibilities and due obligations, and maintain policy consistency.

On public health, President Xi pointed out that the pandemic once again proves that humanity lives in a community with a shared future. There is no higher priority than people’s lives. Solidarity and cooperation is the most powerful weapon for the international community to defeat COVID-19. Response to any major disease must be based on science. Politicizing diseases does no good but only harm. The pressing priority in the global COVID response is to address the vaccine deficits and close the vaccination gap. President Xi said that he suggested making COVID vaccines a global public good at the early stage of the pandemic last year, and put forth a Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative just recently. China is among the first to offer vaccines to developing countries in need, delivering over 1.7 billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to the world. We will consider making additional donations in light of the needs of developing countries. COVID-19 will not be the last public health crisis facing humanity. China and the US need to call for the establishment of a cooperation mechanism for global public health and communicable disease prevention and control, and promote further international exchanges and cooperation.

President Biden said that the US-China relationship is the most important bilateral relations in the world. As two major countries, the US and China have a responsibility to the world as well as to our people. The two sides need to have open and candid dialogues to enhance understanding of each other’s intentions, and make sure that competition between the two countries is fair and healthy and does not veer into conflict. President Biden echoed President Xi’s comment that history is a fair judge, and that they should make the relationship work and not mess it up. China has been a major power since 5,000 years ago. Biden reiterated that the US does not seek to change China’s system, the revitalization of its alliances is not anti-China, and the US has no intention to have a conflict with China. Biden reaffirmed the US government’s long-standing one-China policy, stated that the US does not support “Taiwan independence”, and expressed the hope for peace and stability to be maintained in the Taiwan Strait. The US is willing to work with China on the basis of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence, increase communication, reduce misperception, and handle differences constructively. Biden emphasized the need for the US and China to work more closely in areas where their interests align, respond to global challenges such as the COVID pandemic and climate change, and deliver better lives to the two peoples. We should encourage the younger generation to interact more and be more exposed to each other’s culture, which will help make the world a better place.

The two sides also exchanged views on Afghanistan, the Iranian nuclear issue, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and other international and regional issues of mutual interest.

The two Presidents agreed that their meeting is candid, constructive, substantive and productive. It helps increase mutual understanding, adds to the positive expectation of the international community for this relationship, and sends a powerful message to the two countries and the world. The two sides agreed to maintain close communication in different forms and steer China-US relations back on the right track of sound and steady development, for the good of the people in both countries and around the world.

131121,Wang Yi Speaks on the Phone with US Secretary of State Blinken,"On November 13, 2021, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke on the phone with US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken at the latter’s request.

Wang Yi said that President Xi Jinping will hold a virtual meeting with President Biden on November 16. This meeting, keenly followed by the whole world, is of great significance not just for China-US relations, but also for international relations. It is the shared hope of the two peoples and the international community that the meeting will yield outcomes beneficial to both countries and the world. The helmsmanship of the two heads of state plays a key role in steering bilateral relations. The two sides should work in the same direction and make every preparation to ensure a smooth and successful meeting and bring bilateral relations back onto the track of sound and steady development.

Blinken said that the world is following closely the virtual meeting between the US and Chinese heads of state. Both sides have made full preparation and are making progress. The US side looks forward to sharing views on bilateral ties with the Chinese side during the meeting in the spirit of mutual respect and jointly send a strong message to the world.

In response to the US’ recent wrong words and deeds on the Taiwan question, Wang Yi further elaborated on China’s solemn position. Wang Yi said, both history and reality has fully proven that “Taiwan independence” is the biggest threat to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Any connivance of and support for the “Taiwan independence” forces undermines peace across the Taiwan Strait and would only boomerang in the end. Wang Yi noted, if the US truly wants to safeguard peace across the Taiwan Strait, then it should clearly and resolutely oppose any “Taiwan independence” moves, abide by the solemn commitments it made in the three China-US joint communiques and put the one-China policy into action and stop sending wrong signals to the “Taiwan independence” forces.

The two sides also exchanged views on issues including energy security, climate change and the Iranian nuclear issue, and agreed to maintain dialogue on responding to all kinds of global challenges.",China

Ma Zhaoxu said, the Iranian nuclear situation is now at a critical juncture. Relevant parties should make joint efforts to respond to Iran's legitimate and reasonable concerns, and adopt a positive and pragmatic attitude to push for the resumption of negotiations and make progress along the right track.

Malley briefed the views and  position of the U.S. side on the Iranian nuclear situation. He hopes to maintain communication with China to push for an early resumption of the Iranian nuclear negotiations and achieve results.

311021,Wang Yi Meets with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"On October 31, 2021 local time, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Rome.

Wang Yi said that bilateral relations between China and the United States in the past few years have suffered an all-round impact due to the wrong China policy pursued by the United States. The United States has wantonly interfered in China's internal affairs. The current U.S. Congress has introduced more than 300 anti-China bills, and the United States has included more than 900 Chinese entities and individuals in various unilateral sanctions lists, which severely disrupted normal bilateral exchanges between the two countries. Moreover, the United States is also forming various small cliques to suppress China on a global scale, and even exerting pressure on many small and medium-sized countries. These practices are not in line with the interests of the peoples of the two countries, not in line with the expectations of the international community, not in line with the development trend of the times, and hence China voices its clear opposition.

Wang Yi said that the important experience accumulated over the past four decades since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries is that both China and the United States stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. The two sides have learned from several contacts in Anchorage, Tianjin and Zurich that China and the United States must respect each other and treat each other equally. The Secretary-General of the United Nations has repeatedly called for the world to prevent division and avoid a new Cold War. The important consensus reached by the heads of state of China and the United States during the two phone conversations this year is that the two sides should restart dialogue and avoid confrontation. The urgent task at the moment is that the two sides must earnestly implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state, and make political preparations and provide necessary conditions for the next phase of exchanges.

Wang Yi said that I am willing to establish regular contacts with you to exchange views timely and in a frank manner on how to manage and control differences between our two sides, properly resolve problems that have arisen, so as to enhance understanding, eliminate doubts, avoid misjudgments and explore cooperation.

Wang Yi pointed out that the Taiwan issue is the most sensitive issue between China and the United States. If it is handled wrongly, it will cause subversive and overall damage to bilateral ties. Recently, the situation across the Taiwan Straits has become tense again, and the United States has repeatedly stated that this was caused by China's change of the status quo, yet this is not a fact at all but a serious misleading to the international community. Wang Yi stressed that the true status of the Taiwan issue is that there is only one China, Taiwan is a part of China, and the mainland and Taiwan belong to the same country. Historical experience has repeatedly proved that any change to this status quo will seriously damage the stability and even create a crisis across the Taiwan Straits. The crux of the current situation across the Taiwan Straits is because the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly tried to break through the one-China framework, and the United States' connivance and support for ""Taiwan independence"" forces are also to blame. To stop the development of the ""Taiwan independence"" tendency is to maintain peace across the Taiwan Straits. We urge the United States to realize the serious harm of the ""Taiwan independence"", to pursue a real one-China policy, instead of a fake one, to fulfill its commitments to China faithfully rather than treacherously. We also urge the United States to truly implement the one-China policy and put it into action, instead of saying one thing and doing the opposite.



Blinken reiterated that the United States will continue to adhere to the one-China policy. He said the two sides should develop bilateral relations in the spirit of mutual respect. The United States is willing to maintain communication with China, manage differences responsibly, and avoid confrontation or crisis.

Wang Yi also expressed China's solemn concern over various issues that the United States has harmed China's legitimate rights and interests, and requested the U.S. side to change its course and push China-U.S. relations back onto the track of sound development.

The two sides also exchanged views on important issues such as climate change, energy supply, the Iranian nuclear issue, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Myanmar, and Afghanistan, and expressed the willingness to maintain dialogue on addressing various global challenges.",China
071021,Yang Jiechi Meets with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan,"On October 6, 2021 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi met with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Zurich, Switzerland. The two sides had a comprehensive, candid and in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and international and regional issues of common concern. The meeting was constructive, and conducive to enhancing mutual understanding. The two sides agreed to take action, following the spirit of the phone call between Chinese and U.S. heads of state on September 10, strengthen strategic communication, properly manage differences, avoid conflict and confrontation, seek mutual benefits and win-win results, and work together to bring China-U.S. relations back on the right track of sound and steady development.

Yang Jiechi pointed out that, whether China and the United States can handle their relations well bears on the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples, as well as the future of the world. When China and the United States cooperate, the two countries and the world will benefit; when China and the United States are in confrontation, the two countries and the world will suffer severely. The U.S. side needs to have a deep understanding of the mutually beneficial nature of China-U.S. relations and correctly understand China's domestic and foreign policies and strategic intentions. China opposes defining China-U.S. relations as ""competitive"".

Yang Jiechi said, China attaches importance to the positive remarks on China-U.S. relations made recently by U.S. President Joe Biden, and China has noticed that the U.S. side said it has no intention of containing China's development, and does not seek a ""new Cold War"". China hopes the U.S. side could adopt a rational and pragmatic China policy, and, together with China, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and follow a path of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.

Yang Jiechi expounded China's solemn position on issues related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang and human rights as well as maritime issues, urging the U.S. side to truly respect China's sovereignty, security and development interests, and stop using the above issues to interfere in China's internal affairs.

The U.S. side expressed its adherence to the one-China policy.

The two sides also exchanged views on climate change and regional issues of common concern.

150921,Yang Jiechi Meets with Representatives of the U.S. Democratic and Republican Parties,"On September 15, 2021, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi met via video link with representatives of the U.S. Democratic and Republican parties who attended the 12th China-U.S. Political Party Leaders Dialogue in Beijing.

Yang Jiechi said, President Xi Jinping spoke with President Joseph R. Biden on the phone at the latter's request on September 10, during which the two leaders conducted candid, in-depth and wide-ranging strategic communication and exchanges on China-U.S. relations and other important issues. We hope that the U.S. government will correct the wrong China policy it has carried out for a period of time, meet China halfway and work with China to act positively, implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state and bring bilateral relations back to the right track of stable development as soon as possible. Talks between the political parties of China and the United States are very beneficial to enhancing mutual understanding and deepening dialogue and cooperation. He hopes that people of insight from both parties and all walks of life in the United States will continue to play an active role in the development of bilateral relations.

The U.S. representatives said, this year's dialogue and exchanges between the political parties of China and the United States are candid and in-depth. The relationship between the United States and China is the most important bilateral relationship in the world. People of the two countries and the rest of the world have long benefited from exchanges and cooperation between the United States and China. Global challenges such as tackling of climate change, COVID-19 response and economic recovery call for greater U.S.-China cooperation. The two sides should make efforts to deepen communication, continuously expand cooperation in economy, trade, people-to-people exchanges and other fields, and jointly promote the positive development of U.S.-China relations.",China
100921,Chinese President Xi Jinping Speaks with U.S. President Joseph Biden on the Phone,"On the morning of 10 September 2021, President Xi Jinping took a phone call from U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. The two leaders had candid, in-depth and extensive strategic communication and exchanges on China-U.S. relations and relevant issues of mutual interest.

Xi Jinping first expressed sympathy to Biden and the American people over the human and economic toll in multiple places in the United States caused by Hurricane Ida. Biden appreciated the expression of sympathy.

Xi Jinping pointed out that for some time, due to the U.S. policy on China, the China-U.S. relationship has run into serious difficulty. This serves neither the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, nor the common interests of countries around the world. China and the United States are respectively the biggest developing country and the biggest developed country. Whether they can handle their relationship well bears on the future of the world. It is a question of the century to which the two countries must provide a good answer. When China and the United States cooperate, the two countries and the world will benefit; when China and the United States are in confrontation, the two countries and the world will suffer. Getting the relationship right is not optional, but something we must do and must do well.

Xi Jinping highlighted an ancient Chinese poem, ""Mountains and rivers may block the way, yet another village will appear amidst willow trees and blooming flowers."" Since the ice was broken in bilateral relations in 1971, China and the United States have cooperated with each other and delivered tangible benefits to countries around the world. With the international community facing many common challenges, China and the United States need to show broad vision and shoulder great responsibilities. The two countries should look ahead and press forward, demonstrate strategic courage and political resolve, and bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track of stable development as soon as possible for the good of the people in both countries and around the world.

Xi Jinping elaborated on China's position on climate change and other issues. He stressed that China continues to prioritize ecological conservation and pursues a green and low-carbon path to development, and has taken the initiative to actively shoulder international responsibilities befitting China's national conditions. On the basis of respecting each other's core concerns and properly managing differences, the relevant departments of the two countries may continue their engagement and dialogue to advance coordination and cooperation on climate change, COVID-19 response and economic recovery as well as on major international and regional issues. In the meantime, the two sides may tap more potential of cooperation to inject more positive dynamics into the relationship.

Biden noted that the world is changing fast. The U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential relationship in the world, and the future of the bulk of the world will depend on how the United States and China get on with each other. The two countries have no interest in letting competition veer into conflict. The U.S. side has no intention to change the one-China policy. It is prepared to have more candid exchanges and constructive discussions with China to identify key and priority areas where cooperation is possible, avoid miscommunication, miscalculation and unintended conflict, and get U.S.-China relations back on track. The U.S. side looks forward to more discussions and cooperation with China to reach more common positions on climate change and other important issues.

Both presidents agreed that in-depth communication between them on China-U.S. relations and major international issues is very important for steering the bilateral ties in the right direction. They agreed to maintain frequent contact by multiple means and instruct officials at the working level to intensify the work, conduct extensive dialogue and create conditions for the further development of China-U.S. relations.",China
020921,Yang Jiechi Meets with U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry via Video Link,"On September 2, 2021, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi met with U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry via video link at request.

Yang Jiechi said, for some time China-U.S. relations have faced severe difficulties due to a series of erroneous acts by the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests. China is strongly opposed to and even more resolute in countering such practices. As the confrontation between China and the United States serves no one's interests, the two countries should have mutual respect, coexist peacefully, handle differences properly, and work for mutually beneficial and win-win results. This will serve the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people and people of all countries in the world. Yang Jiechi hopes that the U.S. side can take into consideration the common interests of the two sides and its long-term interests, take concrete steps to rectify wrongdoings, view China and bilateral relations in an objective and rational manner, respect China's political system and development path, and adopt rational and pragmatic China policies to bring bilateral ties back on track with China at an early date.

Yang Jiechi said, China is open to communication, dialogue and pragmatic cooperation with the United States. The two countries can enhance communication, coordination and cooperation on a broad range of bilateral issues such as climate change, COVID-19 response and economic recovery, and also on a series of major international and regional issues. At the same time, such cooperation must be two-way and mutually beneficial.

Noting that China is applying the new development philosophy, Yang Jiechi said, China attaches great importance to tackling climate change and has taken a series of major strategic decisions and strong measures to respond to climate change, demonstrating its active and determined attitude. China respects other countries' rights to development and choice, and China's rights to development and choice must be respected as well. We are ready to beef up policy exchanges and pragmatic cooperation on climate change with the United States to facilitate the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.

Kerry said, U.S.-China relations are very important to the two countries and the world, and the Paris Agreement is an outcome of both countries' joint efforts. The U.S. side is willing to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with China and jointly cope with climate change based on mutual respect, so as to inject impetus into the improvement of bilateral ties.",China
020921,Han Zheng Meets with U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry via Video Link,"On September 2, 2021, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Vice Premier Han Zheng met with visiting U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry via video link in Beijing.

Han Zheng said, China has made great efforts and remarkable achievements in tackling climate change. President Xi Jinping proposed that China will strive to peak its carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This goal and vision reflects China's action and resolve to resolutely perform the Paris Agreement and continuously step up the response to climate change, as well as the country's responsibility and duty for promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. China has been always true in word and resolute in deed on the response to climate change.

Han Zheng pointed out, the cooperation between China and the United States on coping with climate change should return to the Paris Agreement, which serves as an important foundation. He hopes that both sides will focus on implementing the China-U.S. Joint Statement Addressing the Climate Crisis, continue to make efforts under the objectives and principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, and contribute to the global response to climate change. Addressing climate change is an important part of China-U.S. cooperation, which must be based on trust. He hopes that the United States will create a good atmosphere for bilateral cooperation on climate change in accordance with the spirit of the telephone conversation between the two heads of state.

Kerry said, the United States and China should maintain constructive contacts and jointly deal with global challenges. The U.S. side recognizes China's great efforts to cope with climate change, and is willing to strengthen contact and communication with China, press ahead with the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and jointly address the threat of global climate change.",China
010921,Wang Yi Meets with U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry via Video Link at Request,"On September 1, 2021, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry who is in Tianjin for the China-U.S. negotiations on climate change via video link at the latter's request.

Wang Yi said, for China and the United States, as two major countries in the world, cooperation is the only right choice and the keen expectation of the international community. The two countries had carried out fruitful dialogue and cooperation bilaterally and on major international and regional issues including climate change, delivering tangible benefits to the two countries and two peoples, as well as important enlightenment: the two countries should respect each other and seek common ground while shelving differences so as to reach win-win results.



Wang Yi said, in recent years, China-U.S. relations have taken a sharp turn for the worse and are facing serious difficulties. The main reason is that the United States has made a major strategic miscalculation about China. As a Chinese saying goes, ""He who tied the bell should untie it."" The ball now is in the U.S. court. The United States should stop viewing China as a threat and rival, and cease containing and suppressing China all over the world; the United States should attach importance to and actively respond to the ""two lists"" and ""three bottom lines"" put forward by China, and take concrete steps to improve China-U.S. relations, rather than adding new problems to the old ones; the United States should carry out coordination and cooperation at bilateral, regional and global levels, based on the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, instead of one-way traffic.

Wang Yi said, China-U.S. cooperation on climate change not only serves the interests of both sides, but also benefits all mankind, which enjoys broad prospects for development. The U.S. side wants the climate change cooperation to be an ""oasis"" of China-U.S. relations. However, if the oasis is all surrounded by deserts, then sooner or later, the ""oasis"" will be desertified. China-U.S. cooperation on climate change cannot be divorced from the overall situation of China-U.S. relations. The United States should work with China to meet each other halfway and take positive actions to bring China-U.S. relations back on track.



Kerry said, U.S.-China cooperation is of vital importance for responding to the pressing challenge of climate change. The United States is willing to work with China to respect each other, enhance communication and dialogue, jointly improve ambitions, demonstrate both sides' leadership, set an example for meeting the Paris Agreement goals, and also create opportunities for addressing difficulties facing U.S.-China relations.",China
280821,Statement by Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu on Release of US Intelligence Report on COVID-19 Origins,"The US intelligence community has recently compiled a so-called report on the origins of COVID-19. It is a mendacious report made up for political purposes. There is no scientific basis or credibility in it. The US has also released a statement slandering and attacking China. The Chinese side hereby expresses its firm objection. It has made strong representations with the US.

We have stressed on multiple occasions that origins tracing of COVID-19 is a complex issue of science. It should and can only be undertaken by scientists around the world through joint research. The US, however, disregards science and facts. It is instead obsessed with political manipulation and origins tracing by the intelligence community. Without providing any evidence, the US has cooked up one story after another to defame and accuse China. The aim is to use origins tracing to shift blame onto China and spread the political virus. The deployment of the intelligence community in origins tracing is in itself a compelling evidence of the politicization of the issue.

The US accuses China of not being transparent or cooperative on origins tracing. This is sheer nonsense. China attaches great importance to international scientific cooperation on origins tracing, and has taken an active part in such cooperation. Acting on the principles of science, openness and transparency, we have twice invited WHO experts to China for origins tracing research. Early this year, a WHO-China joint study team of leading international and Chinese experts conducted a 28-day research in China and released a Joint Report containing authoritative, professional and science-based conclusions. This is a good foundation for international cooperation on origins tracing. We have been supporting science-based efforts on origins tracing, and will continue to stay actively engaged. That said, we firmly oppose attempts to politicize this issue.

It is actually the US that is not being transparent, responsible and cooperative on this issue. The US has been refusing to respond to the international community's reasonable doubts on the Fort Detrick biolab and the over 200 overseas bases for biological experiments, trying to cover up the truth and avoid being held responsible. The onus is on the US to give the world an answer.

The US attempts to politicize origins tracing have found no support and met widespread opposition from the international community: More than 80 countries have written to the WHO Director-General, issued statements, or sent diplomatic notes to voice their objection to the politicization attempts and call for the Joint Report by the WHO-China joint study team to be upheld; over 300 political parties, social organizations and think tanks from more than 100 countries and regions have submitted a joint statement to the WHO Secretariat on opposing the politicization of origins tracing; and over 25 million Chinese netizens have signed an open letter asking for an inquiry into the Fort Detrick base. These are people's calls for justice.

As a Chinese saying goes, a just cause attracts abundant support, while an unjust one finds little. We want to once again warn the US side that politicizing origins tracing will lead nowhere. We urge the US to immediately stop doing anything that poisons the atmosphere for international cooperation on origins tracing or undermines global solidarity against the pandemic, and return to the right track of science-based origins tracing and cooperation in the face of the pandemic.",China
170821,Wang Yi Speaks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the Phone at Request,"On August 16, 2021, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at request. Both sides mainly exchanged views on the situation in Afghanistan and China-U.S. relations.

Blinken expressed appreciation for China's participation in the Doha meeting on the Afghan issue, noting that the current situation in Afghanistan is entering a crucial stage. The Taliban should announce a clean break with extremism, opt for an orderly transfer of power and establish an inclusive government. Blinken hopes that China will also play an important role to this end. The United States recognizes that the future of Afghanistan should be decided by the Afghan people, calling on the Taliban to ensure the safety of all those who wish to leave the country.

Wang Yi elaborated on China's position on the situation in Afghanistan, saying that facts have once again proved that it is difficult to gain a foothold in a country with a completely different history, culture and national conditions by mechanically copying foreign models. A regime cannot stand without the support of its people, and using power and military means to solve problems will only cause more problems. Such lessons deserve serious reflection.

Wang Yi said that China stands ready to have communication and dialogue with the United States to push for a soft landing of the Afghan issue, so that a new civil war or humanitarian disaster will be prevented in Afghanistan and the country will not relapse into a hotbed and shelter for terrorism. China encourages Afghanistan to establish an open and inclusive political framework in accordance with its own national situations.

Wang Yi said the United States should play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan maintain stability, prevent chaos and rebuild peacefully. The hasty U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has caused a severely adverse impact on the situation in Afghanistan and it would not be responsible if it continues to create new problems.

Wang Yi stressed that it is dangerous and wrong that the last U.S. administration announced to remove the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement from its list of terrorist organizations and apply double standards on the issue of counter-terrorism. The U.S. side should change course and remove obstacles to the Afghan-related cooperation between China and the United States and international counter-terrorism cooperation.

Wang Yi further expressed that both China and the United States are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and important participants in the contemporary international system. In the face of various global challenges and urgent regional hotspot issues, the two countries should carry out coordination and cooperation, which is what the international community is looking forward to. However, the United States cannot, on the one hand, work hard to contain and suppress China and undermine China's legitimate rights and interests. On the other hand, it counts on China's support and cooperation. Such logic has never existed in international exchanges. China and the United States differ in ideology, social system, history and culture. This is an objective fact, and no one can change the other. The right thing to do is to work together on the basis of mutual respect to find a way for the two major countries to coexist peacefully on this planet. History will surely prove that no matter what the United States wants, China-U.S. relations should ultimately pursue such a future and there is only such a path that can be taken. The United States should follow a rational and pragmatic policy towards China, respect China's core interests and major concerns, strengthen dialogue, manage differences and bring China-U.S. relations back on track at an early date in accordance with the spirit of the conversation between the two heads of state.

Blinken said that it is very important for the United States and China to maintain communication on major international and regional issues. I agree that it is a common goal for the United States and China to realize peaceful coexistence, hoping that both sides will seek and carry out cooperation. Of course there are also obvious differences between the two sides, Blinken said, adding that those can be gradually resolved in a constructive way in the days to come. The U.S. side reiterates its opposition to all forms of terrorism and does not seek unrest in China's western border areas. The evolution of the situation in Afghanistan once again shows that it is very important for the United States and China to cooperate on regional security issues in a constructive and pragmatic manner.",China
050821,Wang Yi Sternly Refutes Fallacious Remarks by the United States and Japan that Interfere in China's Internal Affairs.,"On the evening of August 4, 2021, the United States and Japan brought forward issues related to Xinjiang and Hong Kong at the 11th East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting to attack China on grounds of human rights after State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's speech on East Asia cooperation. Wang Yi asked for the floor for the second time to sternly rebut these remarks.

Wang Yi said, the United States and a few certain countries, as expected, intended to use this multilateral platform to attack and smear China on issues related to our internal affairs . Such smearing remarks are cliche that is not worthy of refuting at all, and the ASEAN countries have not echoed. Nevertheless, China has the right for sure to make refutation based on the reciprocity principle.

Noting that affairs related to Xinjiang and Hong Kong are all China's internal affairs, Wang Yi said, making irresponsible remarks on China's internal affairs has seriously breached the basic norms governing international relations, and undermined the principle of national sovereign equality. For such abominable behavior, we will resolutely make refutation each and every time it comes up.

Wang Yi said, in recent years, the people of the Uygur ethnic group in Xinjiang have experienced a doubling of their population and average life expectancy, the constant increase of income year by year and the elevation of education level. Then, how come there is the so-called ""genocide""? Speaking of ""genocide"", the previous massive killing exercised by the United States on American Indians is the real genocide. And the massive casualties suffered by innocent civilians as a result of warfare waged by the United States worldwide are crimes against humanity in name and in fact.

Wang Yi said, with an open and transparent attitude, the Government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China has repeatedly refuted all kinds of lies using facts and data. Ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, including the Uygur ethnic group, have stood up and shared their personal stories to fight back against all kinds of misinformation. However, the United States has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to this. Where is your conscience? Where is your credibility? The paranoia you have shown is typical Western-style arrogance and impertinence.

Wang Yi said, the enactment of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the reform of the electoral system have restored stability and improved the rule of law in Hong Kong, and ensured the legitimate rights and interests of Hong Kong residents and all people living in Hong Kong, making the One Country, Two Systems go steadily and far. 70 percent of Hong Kong people are satisfied with the current situation. Now you are expressing your so-called concerns, then what are you concerned about? You want Hong Kong to return to chaos and turmoil, and ""Hong Kong independence"" forces to take to the streets again? Is that what you want? I want to make this clear: drop your illusions. It is impossible for you to see that day!",China
260721,"Xie Feng: The United States is the ""inventor, and patent and intellectual property owner"" of coercive diplomacy","On 26 July, during his talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said the Chinese believe that one must not do to others what one does not like to be done to himself. Desire to seek hegemony or territorial expansion is simply not in the Chinese DNA. And China has never coerced any country. China responds to foreign interference with legitimate and lawful countermeasures. The aim is to defend the legitimate rights and interests of the country and uphold international equity and justice. China has never gone to others' doorsteps to provoke trouble. Neither has China ever stretched its arm into the households of others, still less has China ever occupied any inch of other countries' territory. It is the United States, not anybody else, who is the inventor, and patent and intellectual property owner of coercive diplomacy. It is the United States who has engaged in broad unilateral sanctions, long-arm jurisdiction and interference in other countries' internal affairs. The U.S. notion of “engaging other countries from a position of strength"" is just another version of the big bullying the small and “might is right”. This is pure coercive diplomacy.",China

The Chinese people cherish peace. What China hopes to build is a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation, and a community with a shared future for mankind. China wants to work with the United States to seek common ground while shelving the differences. The U.S. side needs to change course and work with China on the basis of mutual respect and embrace fair competition and peaceful coexistence with China. After all, a healthy and stable China-U.S. relationship serves the interests of both sides. And the world expects nothing less from the two sides.",China
260721,Xie Feng: How can the United States portray itself as the world's spokesperson for democracy and human rights?,"On 26 July, during his talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng urged the U.S. side to address its own human rights issues first.

Xie Feng pointed out that historically, the United States engaged in genocide against Native Americans. Presently, the United States has lost 620,000 lives because of its halting response to COVID-19. Internationally, the frequent U.S. military action and the wars caused by the United States lying about the facts have brought undue catastrophe to the world. How can the United States portray itself as the world's spokesperson for democracy and human rights?

Xie Feng said that the U.S. side is in no position to lecture China on democracy and human rights. Without the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, an effective political system and a development path suited to China's circumstances, or if people on the street in China were all denied democracy, freedoms and human rights, how could it be possible for the Chinese people to ever generate such immense creativity and productivity? Without those, how could a super-sized country like China

with over a billion people ever achieve the twin miracles of rapid economic growth and sustained social stability? And how could it be possible for the Chinese nation to make the great transformation from standing up to growing rich, and to becoming strong within just a hundred years? Western surveys have shown that over 90 percent of Chinese are satisfied with the Government, which is quite remarkable for any country in the world.",China
260721,"Xie Feng: The U.S. side's so-called ""rules-based international order"" is designed to benefit itself at others' expense, hold other countries back and introduce ""the law of the jungle""","On 26 July, during his talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng made the comment that the U.S. side's so-called “rules-based international order” is an effort by the United States and a few other Western countries to frame their own rules as international rules and impose them on other countries. The United States has abandoned the universally-recognized international law and order and damaged the international system it has helped to build. And it is trying to replace it with a so-called “rules-based international order”. The purpose is to resort to the tactic of changing the rules to make life easy for itself and hard for others, and to introduce “the law of the jungle"" where might is right and the big bully the small.",China
260721,"The China-U.S. relationship is in a stalemate, fundamentally because some Americans portray China as an ""imagined enemy""","On 26 July, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said during talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman that the China-US relationship is now in a stalemate and faces serious difficulties. Fundamentally, it is because some Americans portray China as an “imagined enemy"". For quite some time, when talking about conflict with China and challenges facing the U.S., the ""Pearl Harbor moment"" and the “Sputnik moment"" have been brought up by some Americans. What does it imply? Some international scholars, including some U.S. academics, perceive this as comparing China to Japan in the Second World War and the Soviet Union in the Cold War. It seems as if by making China an “imagined enemy"", a national sense of purpose would be reignited in the U.S.. The hope may be that by demonizing China, the U.S. could somehow shift domestic public discontent over political, economic and social issues and blame China for its own structural problems. It seems that a whole-of-government and whole-of-society campaign is being waged to bring China down. It is as if when China's development is contained, all U.S. domestic and external challenges would go away, and America would become great again and Pax Americana would continue to go on. The U.S. keeps making an issue with China. It's as if the U.S. side has nothing to talk about except about China. We urge the United States to change its highly misguided mindset and dangerous policy.",China
100721,Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng: To Destabilize China is Not the Solution to American Problems,"On July 9, 2021, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in an interview on the ""China Forum"" column of guancha.cn, some persons in the U.S. try every means to blame China for problems in the U.S. For a superpower like the U.S., the biggest challenge is always itself, and to destabilize China is by no means the solution to American problems. China has no intention to compete with the U.S., but to seek its own progress and breakthrough. We have no strategy of seeking hegemony, but to pursue its own development. Its aim is to realize the people's aspiration for a better life. The engagement with China from the so-called ""position of strength"" exposes the hegemonistic mindset and Cold War mentality, reflecting the U.S. is flexing muscles, and wielding a stick to scare others. Intimidation will never work on the Chinese people. Even in the years when we were in dire poverty, and our army had only millet to eat and only rifles to fight with, we had never been scared by any one, let alone the present ""position of strength"".",China
100721,Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng: Some Western Countries Led by the U.S. Have No Right to Talk Democracy and Human Rights with China,"On July 9, 2021, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said in an interview on the ""China Forum"" column of guancha.cn, some Western countries led by the U.S. have no right to talk democracy and human rights with China because of their own deplorable human rights record. In history, they committed genocide against the aboriginal people, and discriminated and persecuted minority groups. Over nearly 100 years after the U.S. was founded, native Indians were expelled and killed during the Westward Expansion. Their population dwindled from 5 million to 250,000, only accounting for 2 percent of the U.S. total. The remains of over 200 children and more than 1,000 unmarked graves were found at the site of a former residential school for indigenous children in Canada. Over 160 years, at least 4,000 children died at the residential schools without clear reason. Until today, people like George Floyd cannot breathe freely, minority groups are suffering from discrimination and the homeless are wandering in the streets. How shameless are such countries to lecture others on human rights in a condescending manner and point fingers? To put it bluntly, they only interfere in other countries' domestic affairs under the disguise of human rights.",China
120621,Yang Jiechi States China's Solemn Position on Issues Related to Xinjiang and Hong Kong,"On June 11, 2021, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi had a phone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the latter's request, and stated China's solemn position on issues related to Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Yang Jiechi pointed out that recent signs indicate that some anti-China forces are trying to stir up one after another sinister waves to smear China under the excuse of the so-called Xinjiang and Hong Kong-related issues, and they are doomed to failure. The issues related to Xinjiang and Hong Kong concern China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and involve China's core interests. We urge the U.S. side to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, not to interfere in China's internal affairs under any pretext, and not to damage China's core interests in any way.

Yang Jiechi stressed that the issues related to Xinjiang are not so-called human rights or religion issues. Seeing violent and terrorist incidents on the rise in Xinjiang, the Chinese government took resolute actions to safeguard public safety, which are totally justified. The U.S. side has fabricated various lies about Xinjiang in an attempt to sabotage the stability and unity in Xinjiang, which confuse right and wrong and are extremely absurd. China is firmly opposed to such actions. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. The aim of improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is to safeguard the constitutional order of the HKSAR as defined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic Law of the HKSAR, and ensure that ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" with patriots as the mainstay. It is a common practice in the world to make strict requirements on the patriotic stance and political qualifications of those who govern. Those clamoring for ""Hong Kong independence"" are not eligible to participate in the administration of Hong Kong and must be punished by the national security law in Hong Kong.",China
110621,Yang Jiechi Speaks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the Phone at Request,"On June 11, 2021, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi had a phone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the latter's request.

Yang Jiechi said, dialogue and cooperation should be the mainstream of China-U.S. relations. Cooperation should be mutually beneficial, and address the concerns of both sides in a balanced way. China is committed to developing a relationship with the U.S. featuring non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, China will firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. We urge the U.S. side to follow the spirit of the phone conversation between the two heads of state on the Chinese New Year's Eve, and to jointly bring bilateral relations back to the right track of development. The Taiwan question concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and involves China's core interests. There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. China resolutely defends its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We urge the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle, honor its promise and cherish its credibility, prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues, and maintain the overall situation of China-U.S. ties and the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait with concrete actions.

Yang Jiechi stressed, there is only one system and one order in the world: the international system with the United Nations (UN) at the core and the international order based on international law, instead of the so-called system and order advocated by a handful of countries. There is only one set of rules: the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, instead of the so-called rules formulated by a small number of countries. There is only one kind of multilateralism, which is genuine multilateralism based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter as well as international law, and featuring equal treatment, cooperation and mutual benefits, not pseudo-multilateralism based on interests of small cliques and group politics, letting alone practicing unilateralism in the name of multilateralism. Peace and development, fairness and justice, democracy and freedom are the common values of all humankind. Respect for sovereignty is a prerequisite for the realization of human rights, which is a principle affirmed by the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The U.S. should fix its serious human rights violations on its own territory, instead of wilfully interfering in the internal affairs of other countries with the so-called human rights as an excuse.

Yang Jiechi pointed out, China has actively participated in and supported international anti-virus cooperation, and it resolutely opposes any despicable acts that use the pandemic as an excuse to smear China and to shift blames. China is gravely concerned over some U.S. individuals fabricating and peddling the absurd story that Wuhan lab leaked the COVID-19 virus. China urges the U.S. to respect facts and science, restrain from politicizing COVID-19 origin tracing, and remain focused on international anti-pandemic cooperation.

Yang Jiechi said, China will celebrate the CPC's centenary. The Chinese people have scored great achievements under the strong leadership of the CPC, and they will unite more closely and work harder, firmly walk along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, build China into a more prosperous country and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

Blinken said, the recent series of contacts between the U.S. and China is beneficial to bilateral ties and the U.S. looks forward to increasing contacts and exchanges with China at various levels. The U.S. pursues the one-China policy and remains committed to abiding by the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques. The U.S. hopes to maintain communication and coordination with China on major international and regional issues.

The two sides also exchanged views on other issues of common concern.",China
290521,Drawing on History and Looking to the Future to Advance China-U.S. Relations along the Right Track,"This year marks the 50th anniversary of China-U.S. Ping-Pong diplomacy. In April 1971, the U.S. table tennis team, which was attending the 31st World Table Tennis Championships in Nagoya, Japan, paid a visit to China at the invitation of the Chinese table tennis team. One year later, the Chinese team made a return visit to the United States. During the visits, both teams were warmly welcomed and received by each other's country and people. The two sides enabled the little ball to move the big ball, thus thawing the ice of over two decades of estrangement between the two countries.

Back fifty years ago, the elder generation of Chinese and American leaders-Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, President Richard Nixon and Dr. Henry Kissinger-acted in the common interests of the two peoples and demonstrated strategic vision and extraordinary political courage, with their strategic decision to reopen the door of exchanges between China and the United States. They were personally involved in the decision-making to bring about the Ping-Pong diplomacy. In July 1971, Dr. Kissinger paid a secret visit to China. In February 1972, President Nixon visited China. A ""handshake that crossed the vast Pacific Ocean"" was realized between China and the United States, which opened a new chapter in relations between the two countries.

II

Over the past five decades, China-U.S. relations have braved wind and rain and continued to move forward and score historic achievements. This has not only brought real benefits to the two countries and peoples but also contributed significantly to world peace, stability and prosperity.

Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China-U.S. trade has kept growing on a steady basis. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, trade in goods grew by 8.3 percent last year to exceed US$580 billion. In the first quarter of this year, two-way trade surged by 61.3 percent over the same period of last year. Such trade and economic cooperation has served the mutual benefit of the two sides over the years.

China and the United States have joined forces for the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on climate change, lending important impetus to global climate cooperation. On 22 April, President Xi Jinping attended the Leaders Summit on Climate at the invitation of President Joe Biden and delivered important remarks. President Xi underlined that China looks forward to working with the international community including the United States to jointly advance global environmental governance. At an earlier date, the two sides also released a Joint Statement Addressing the Climate Crisis in Shanghai. China and the United States worked together in responding to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 international financial crisis, making important contribution to international financial stability and world economic recovery. China and the United States have carried out trilateral cooperation on food security in Timor-Leste and jointly combated Ebola in Africa. The two sides have also coordinated effectively in such fields as counter-terrorism, nonproliferation, anti-narcotics, disease prevention and control and peacekeeping, and have maintained communication and coordination on the Middle East and other regional hotspot issues.

Chinese leaders have been involved on a personal basis in promoting people-to-people exchanges between the two countries. Over the years, President Xi Jinping has attached great importance to and been personally engaged in people-to-people interactions between the two sides. His 30-year long friendship with old friends in Iowa and his support to Elizabeth Gardner who, in her late 70s, fulfilled her late husband's wish to revisit Guling in Fujian province, are all fondly remembered stories of China-U.S. people-to-people exchanges.

Since the mutual visits between the two table tennis teams in 1972, Chinese and American table tennis players have engaged in frequent exchanges. In 2002, the Chinese table tennis team was invited to Chicago and Los Angeles, where three generations of table tennis players from both sides gathered to renew the friendship initiated by Ping-Pong diplomacy. The two sides have also enjoyed close exchanges and cooperation in the field of arts and culture and on natural disaster response,and have supported and assisted each other in addressing COVID-19.

There are now 50 pairs of sister provinces and states and 232 pairs of sister cities between the two countries. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, people across sectors in the two countries have maintained frequent contacts, through either phone calls, correspondence or video conferences. All these come as the result of long-term dedication and commitment by Chinese and American peoples through generations, and all must be cherished and taken good care of by both countries.

III

As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of Ping-Pong diplomacy, we look back at the past journey of China-U.S. relations, with all its ups and downs, so that we could learn from history, stick to the present and open up the future. To say the least, that past history may give us the following three important inspirations:

First, China and the United States need to and are fully capable of living in peace and engage in win-win cooperation. The fundamental reason why the two countries were able to break the ice of long-term antagonism and estrangement to establish full diplomatic ties fifty years ago,and why they have since enjoyed fruitful cooperation across the board, lies in the very fact that both countries have managed to act in the shared interests of the two countries and two peoples, as they aspired to seek common ground while reserving differences on the basis of respecting each other's political systems and development models.

The Shanghai Communiqué of 1972 explicitly stated that ""there are essential differences between China and the United States in their social systems and foreign policies. Yet, the two sides agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states, non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence"". The two sides stated that progress toward normalizing China-U.S. relations served the interest of all countries. The Shanghai Communiqué, the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, and the 1982 Joint Communiqué established the principles of mutual respect, equality and seeking common ground while putting aside differences as the guiding principles in conducting China-U.S. relations. They form the political foundation of China-U.S. relations.

It is not China's intention to dismiss the political system and development path of the United States or any country in the world. Nor is it China's desire to disseminate its own political system and development path elsewhere. Nonetheless, the Chinese people will never concede to anyone attempting to challenge the Communist Party of China, China's political system, or its structure of leadership. China will firmly defend its own sovereignty, security and development interests.

It is normal that China and the United States may have differences. What is crucial is that the two countries respect and treat each other as equals, and manage their differences constructively to ensure that the bilateral relationship move forward in the right direction.

Second, as the largest developing country and the largest developed country, and as the world's two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council, China and the United States shoulder special global responsibilities and obligations, and share extensive and important common interests. China and the United States working together can make great things happen for the two countries and the world at large, while the two countries stuck in confrontation spells disaster for both countries and beyond.

Never before have countries in the world been so interdependent and so closely interconnected. Humankind are in a community with a shared future. No country can prosper in isolation or meet all challenges on its own. Embracing unity, cooperation and coordination is the only right way forward. China and the United States should keep pace with the times, and view and handle their relationship with a broader vision and mind. The two countries should work together toward a new model of major-country relations featuring non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, so as to make important contribution to peace and development in the world.

As a big developing country with 1.4 billion people, China has tremendous market potentials. We are stepping up efforts to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. We will further improve the business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law, and up to international standards. All this will create greater development space for companies from around the world, including those from the United States. We are happy to see American companies succeed in China. We hope they will join us in keeping industrial and supply chains safe and stable for the benefit of both sides.

COVID-19 is the common enemy of humankind, and containing the pandemic should become a new platform for China-U.S. cooperation. Medical experts, research teams and businesses from the two countries should work more closely together on vaccine R&D and COVID response to contribute to the global fight against the virus.

Climate change concerns the future of humankind, and it calls for a joint response from all countries. China and the United States should work with other parties to better enforce the Paris Agreement and ensure the success of COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity, COP26 to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and other events, so as to contribute to the global endeavor to address climate and environment challenges and build a community of life for man and Nature.

China is ready to enhance cooperation with the United States on counter-terrorism, non-proliferation and other international and regional issues as well as under multilateral frameworks including the United Nations and the G20, so as to jointly safeguard regional and world peace, stability and development.

Third, people-to-people exchange is an important foundation and enduring driving force for the sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations. ""Amity between the people holds the key to state-to-state relations."" Over the past five decades since Ping-Pong diplomacy, people-to-people exchange has played an increasingly important role in upholding and advancing China-U.S. relations. Communication and interaction between the two peoples from various sectors help to deepen mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries, expand common interests of the two peoples, and facilitate sound development of bilateral relations. In recent years, some in the United States, out of the Cold-War zero-sum mentality, have caused disruption and created obstacles to normal people-to-people exchanges. They stood on the wrong side of history and moved against the will of the people, and their attempt enjoyed no support from the people.

It is the people that make history. Every day stories take place of friendly exchanges between the Chinese and American peoples. Last month, the fifth China-U.S. Subnational Legislatures Cooperation Forum was successfully held online. Leading officials of seven Chinese provincial legislatures and seven U.S. state legislatures spoke at the event. Chinese and U.S. friendly organizations co-hosted the China-U.S. Agriculture Roundtable. Leading officials of agricultural departments, representatives from subnational governments, the business community and educational institutions of both countries, as well as members of the U.S. Congress attended the event and sent video messages. And they actively explored opportunities for business, educational, and think-tank exchanges and cooperation. Earlier this month, the two sides held commemorations in Beijing for the 50th anniversary of Ping-Pong diplomacy. Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan and former U.S. Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger delivered important remarks through video links, and representatives from political, business, academic, sport and other sectors of both countries attended the event. Chinese and American participants who were involved in Ping-Pong diplomacy 50 years ago played a virtual ping-pong game in a lively atmosphere that touched the hearts of the audience in both countries.

It is now important that we listen to the call of the people on both sides for peace, development and cooperation, and work to create enabling conditions for exchanges and cooperation at the subnational levels and between businesses, think tanks, media and non-governmental groups of the two sides, so that more will join, benefit from and become supporters of China-U.S. relations.

We see in front of us the unstoppable trend of friendly exchanges between the Chinese and American peoples, as well as the common aspiration of the two peoples and the wider world for China-U.S. relations to maintain stability and grow further. We hope that the United States will work with China to carry forward and promote the spirit of Ping-Pong diplomacy. We hope the two sides will act on the guidance of the phone call conversation between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden, take a clear grasp of the global trend, and go along the tide of the times. We hope the two sides could focus on cooperation, manage differences, move China-U.S. relations forward in a sound and steady manner, and work with other countries in the world to jointly advance the noble cause of world peace and development.",China
250421,Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng Meets with U.S. Businessmen,"On April 22, 2021, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng met with the delegation of American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai (AmCham Shanghai) led by Chair Jeff Lehman and President Ker Gibbs. Both sides exchanged views on issues such as China-U.S. relations, and personnel flow facilitation amid the pandemic. Representatives from enterprises such as General Motors, Ford Motor, Walt Disney, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, United Parcel Service, and Concordia International School of Shanghai attended the meeting.

Xie Feng expressed, since the early 20th century, mankind has suffered the scourges of two world wars, but shared more than five decades of peace dividend and witnessed the fastest economic growth. In particular, the overall sound and stable progress of China-U.S. relations since the two countries reopened the door of exchanges contributes to this achievement. History shows both countries gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Their cooperation can benefit the two countries and the whole world, while confrontation will surely spell disaster for both countries and the wider world. Faced with global challenges to combat COVID-19, recover the economy, and address climate change, the international community has no other choice but to strengthen unity and cooperation. China and the United States should correspond to the shared aspiration of the international community for peace and development, respect the strong desire of the people of the two countries for exchanges and cooperation, and treat and handle bilateral relations with an open mind and a sense of responsibility of a major country.



Xie Feng pointed out, it is negative and unconstructive to define China-U.S. relations with ""competition, cooperation and confrontation"". Admittedly, there is competition between China and the United States, but the competition should be healthy. It is like competing with each other for excellence in a racing field, not beating each other on a wrestling arena. Cooperation serves the common interests of both countries, so it should be the shared target and the mainstream of the bilateral ties. China and the United States are different in history, culture, development stage and social system, so it is natural that both countries may have different views on certain issues. The right attitude is to step up dialogues, deepen cooperation, narrow differences, and avoid confrontation. The right approach is mutual respect and equal consultation for win-win results.

Xie Feng emphasized, China will further deepen reform and opening-up, and make institutional innovations for an open economy of higher standards. China is fostering a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. Under this new development paradigm, China will open up more areas and more sectors at a deeper level, and build a market-oriented, law-based and international business environment. China welcomes U.S. enterprises to actively participate in the process and leverage the historic opportunity. U.S. enterprises are interested parties of China-U.S. cooperation. China wishes to see U.S. enterprises exert positive influence in urging the U.S. government to lift tariffs on Chinese goods, stop decoupling, supply disruption, and arbitrary oppression against Chinese companies, and provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese companies operating in the U.S.

Business representatives of members of AmCham Shanghai introduced their operation and investment in China. They attach high importance to Chinese market, and are optimistic about the prospect of China's development. They will expand investment and cooperation in China. In addition, they spoke highly of China's timely and effective control of the COVID-19 with rigorous measures, and thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other departments of China for providing convenience and support for their turn to China and resumption of work and production, expecting China's support in addressing the difficulties related to personnel flow and vaccination. AmCham Shanghai will play a positive role in promoting dialogues and cooperation between the United States and China.",China
240421,Wang Yi Holds Virtual Dialogue with the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations,"On the evening of April 23, 2021, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a virtual dialogue with the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Beijing.

Wang Yi said that the Presidents of the two countries had an important phone conversation on the eve of the Chinese New Year, charting the course for the relationship. The Anchorage dialogue kicked off face-to-face interactions at the high level in the context of COVID-19. But the new administration of the United States, in shaping its China policy, has not stepped out of the shadow of the previous administration, has not got over its misperception of China, and has not found the right way to engage with China.



Wang Yi shared the following five points on China-U.S. relations from a strategic perspective. First, we hope that the United States will view China's development in an objective and rational way. China is committed to a path of peaceful development, one that underlines peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation with countries around the world. China never seeks global hegemony. China will blaze a path of peaceful rise distinct from the trajectory of traditional powers. The wisdom from China's millennia of history is that hegemony will lead to failure, and that a strong country should not seek hegemony. China pursues development and rejuvenation through its own hard work. In everything we do, we do it for a better life for the Chinese people, rather than seeking to replace or unseat any other country. When we stress ""looking at each other on an equal level"", we mean nothing but equality. We do not accept that any country can dictate to others from a position of strength. Respect is to be earned with hard work, be it a country or a person. Major countries in particular should uphold justice and observe norms, and lead by the power of example. The success of one side does not mean that the other side has to fail. The world is big enough to accommodate a more successful China and a more successful America. Decoupling from the world's second largest economy and turning against the 1.4 billion Chinese people will not help solve America's problems. It will cause chaos in the world.

Second, we hope that the United States will work with China to explore a new path of peaceful co-existence and mutually beneficial cooperation. The U.S. side defines China-U.S. relations as having competitive, cooperative and adversarial aspects. It blurs the distinction between the ""mainstream"" and ""sub-stream"" of the relations and reflects a lack of a clear direction and goal. China has no intention to compete with the United States. What matters to us is constant progress and self-improvement. Confrontation will only lead to a lose-lose situation. Cooperation is the only right way forward and it should be a two-way street and mutually beneficial, instead of one side upping the ante and putting its interests first. The right approach to China-U.S. relations is to step up dialogue, deepen cooperation, narrow differences and avoid confrontation. The key is whether the United States can accept the peaceful rise of a major country with a different social system, history and culture, and in a different development stage; whether it can recognize the Chinese people's right to pursue development and a better life.

Third, we hope the United States will respect and accommodate the path and system China has chosen for itself. What has happened shows that China's socialist path with its own characteristics has not just leveled up the 1.4 billion Chinese people from poverty and backwardness, it also marks another major contribution of the Chinese nation to human progress. China's socialist democracy is a whole-process, most representative democracy. It embodies the will of the people, fits the country's realities, and is endorsed by the people. It is undemocratic in itself to label China as ""authoritarian"" or ""dictatorship"" simply because China's democracy takes a different form than that of the United States. We advocate that each country can choose a development path in light of its own circumstances and its people's need, and we uphold the common values of humanity, i.e. peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom. A peaceful world should nurture diverse civilizations. A stable order should accommodate different systems. And a confident major country should be inclusive to diverse values. The most important thing that we learned from decades of China-U.S. exchanges is that our difference in social system does not prevent us from seeking common ground while shelving differences and pursuing win-win cooperation and peaceful co-existence.



Fourth, we hope that the United States will practice true multilateralism. China has helped establish, contributed to and upheld the existing international system. The previous U.S. administration willfully walked away from international organizations, commitments and responsibilities, seriously disrupting the existing international system. We welcome the Biden administration to return to multilateralism. That said, China believes that true multilateralism means openness, inclusiveness, rule of law, consultation, cooperation, and keeping pace with the times. Multilateralism should not be used to form new opposing blocs or exclusive circles. We must uphold the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law. This represents true multilateralism in practice.

Fifth, we hope that the United States will not interfere in China's internal affairs. Sovereignty and territorial integrity are a country's core interests. China has no room for compromise on such a major issue of principle. Playing the ""Taiwan card"" is dangerous, like playing with fire. We hope that the United States will abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, and not send any wrong signals to the ""Taiwan independence"" elements, or try to challenge, still less cross, China's policy red line. The Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion. They are about fighting violent terrorism, separatism and extremism. We welcome American friends to visit Xinjiang to see for themselves what it is really like there, and not fall for lies or rumors. The enactment of the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR and the decision to improve Hong Kong's electoral system both serve to improve the system of One Country, Two Systems, ensure the sound and steady implementation of One Country, Two Systems, ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy, and achieve long-term security in Hong Kong. The United States should respect the Chinese government's efforts to implement One Country, Two Systems. A long-running feature of China's foreign policy is that all countries are equal regardless of their size. We do not act in a coercive way, and we firmly oppose any country doing so. But when China's national sovereignty and dignity are being coerced and undermined, we undoubtedly need to respond with reasonable and lawful actions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests as well as international equity and justice. China never threatens other countries with the use of force, builds military alliances, exports ideology, incites troubles in other countries' doorsteps or meddles in their affairs. Neither has China ever started a trade war or wantonly gone after foreign companies. We are prepared to work with other countries against any act of coercion in the world.



Wang Yi said that China and the United States should transcend the fate of ""unavoidable conflicts between an emerging major country and an established major country"", transcend the differences in ideology and social system, transcend the mentalities of cold war and bloc confrontation, and explore the path of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between the two countries instead. He hopes the CFR will take an objective and impartial stance, and play a constructive role in bringing China-U.S. relations back to the right track.

Wang Yi also answered questions about economy and trade, Xinjiang and Hong Kong and Taiwan-related matters, China's exertion of power, China's political system and important international and regional issues, and provided deep insights into China's principled positions.

Bringing China-U.S. Relations Back to the Track of
Sound and Steady Development","Friends,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

Ambassador Richard Haass is my old friend. And I happily accepted his invitation to exchange views with friends from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) via video link. First of all, let me take this opportunity to express warm congratulations on the Council's 100th anniversary. Over the century, the CFR has witnessed the vicissitudes of the world and made important contributions to China-U.S. relations. Given the current difficulties in bilateral relations, we hope that the CFR will uphold an objective and just position and continue to play a constructive role in bringing China-U.S. relations back to the right track.

Friends,

The Presidents of the two countries had an important phone conversation on the eve of the Chinese New Year, charting the course for the relationship. The Anchorage dialogue kicked off face-to-face interactions at the high level in the context of COVID-19. Our two countries recently issued a Joint Statement Addressing the Climate Crisis. Yesterday, President Xi Jinping attended the Leaders Summit on Climate at the invitation of President Joe Biden, demonstrating the sense of responsibility of our two countries in joining hands to tackle global challenges. At the same time, we have noted that the new U.S. administration has described China as its ""most serious competitor"". The United States still interferes in China's internal affairs, including Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong-related matters. To be frank, the United States, in shaping its China policy, has not stepped out of the shadow of the previous administration, has not got over its misperception of China, and has not found the right way to engage with China. With this in mind, I'd like to share with you the following points from a strategic perspective.

First, we hope that the United States will view China's development in an objective and rational way.

China is committed to a path of peaceful development, one that underlines peaceful coexistence and mutually beneficial cooperation with countries around the world. China never seeks global hegemony. China will blaze a path of peaceful rise distinct from the trajectory of traditional powers. The wisdom from China's millennia of history is that hegemony will lead to failure, and that a strong country should not seek hegemony. China pursues development and rejuvenation through its own hard work, instead of aggression or expansion. In everything we do, we do it for a better life for the Chinese people, rather than seeking to replace or unseat any other country.

Some in the United States claim that China does not respect the United States any more. As a matter of fact, it is China that values mutual respect and equality the most. When we stress ""looking at each other on an equal level"", we mean nothing but equality. It is neither looking down, or looking up. Stronger muscles and bigger fists should not be the decisive factor. There is no superior country in this world, and we do not accept that any country can dictate to others from a position of strength. Respect is to be earned with hard work, be it a country or a person. Major countries in particular should uphold justice and observe norms, and lead by the power of example.

The U.S. side repeatedly said that one should ""never bet against America"". This, in fact, is a zero-sum mentality. China never bets against other countries. In this global village, China welcomes early progress in COVID response and full economic recovery in the United States. The success of one side does not mean that the other side has to fail. The world is big enough to accommodate a more successful China and a more successful America. The United States needs to stay confident, rather than suspicious. As Harvard Professor Joseph Nye said, America must avoid exaggerated fears, which can lead to overreaction.

We noted that the Biden administration stated that it would prioritize domestic issues and focus on serving the American working class. When the domestic issues are effectively addressed, the United States will maintain its vitality. Shifting blames to others, or even decoupling from the world's second largest economy and turning against the 1.4 billion Chinese people will not help solve America's problems. It will cause chaos in the world. The U.S. business community has made a clear point that they cannot afford to be locked out of the China market.

Second, we hope that the United States will work with China to explore a new path of peaceful co-existence and mutually beneficial cooperation.

China and the United States should uphold the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, and actively explore a way of peaceful co-existence between two major countries with different social systems. The U.S. side defines China-U.S. relations as having competitive, cooperative and adversarial aspects. It blurs the distinction between the ""mainstream"" and ""sub-stream"" of the relations and reflects a lack of a clear direction and goal. First, China has no intention to compete with the United States. What matters to us is constant progress and self-improvement. Second, if confrontation is played up, it will only lead to a lose-lose situation and thus should not be the orientation of the U.S. China policy. Cooperation is the only right way forward that meets the common aspiration of the two countries and the world. Cooperation should be a two-way street and mutually beneficial, instead of one side upping the ante and putting its interests first. We maintain that the right approach to China-U.S. relations is to step up dialogue, deepen cooperation, narrow differences and avoid confrontation.

China and the United States working together can make the ""impossible"" possible, and steer the bilateral ties toward sound and steady development. As for areas of cooperation, the most outstanding is joint efforts to address climate change, the most pressing is joint response to COVID-19, and the most promising is economic and trade cooperation.

China-U.S. relations are at a new crossroads. The key is whether the United States can accept the peaceful rise of a major country with a different social system, history and culture, and in a different development stage; whether it can recognize the Chinese people's right to pursue development and a better life. The future of China-U.S. relations largely hinges on the answer of the United States to these two questions.

Third, we hope the United States will respect and accommodate the path and system China has chosen for itself.

What has happened shows that China's socialist path with its own characteristics has not just leveled up the 1.4 billion Chinese people from poverty and backwardness, it also marks another major contribution of the Chinese nation to human progress. No one is entitled to negate the development paths of other countries, and no country will mold its system to others' liking. At the end of the day, it is up to the people to decide whether their system and path work or not. China never copies others' model. Neither does China export ideology or urge others to copy its way. What we advocate is that each country can choose a development path in light of its own circumstances and its people's need, and all countries should respect and learn from each other.

Recently, some people tend to describe China-U.S. relations as ""democracy versus authoritarianism"", seeking to draw the line along ideology and pin labels on countries. But democracy is not Coca-Cola, which, with the syrup produced by the United States, tastes the same across the world. The world will be lifeless and dull, if there is only one single model and one single civilization.

China's socialist democracy is a whole-process, most representative democracy. It embodies the will of the people, fits the country's realities, and is endorsed by the people. It is undemocratic in itself to label China as ""authoritarian"" or ""dictatorship"" simply because China's democracy takes a different form than that of the United States. Using democracy and human rights to conduct values-oriented diplomacy, meddle in other countries' internal affairs or stoke confrontation will only lead to turmoil or even disaster.

President Xi Jinping's proposal to build a community with a shared future for mankind embodies the hope to rise above the differences in social system, abandon the zero-sum mentality and uphold the common values of humanity, i.e. peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom. All countries need to work together to protect Planet Earth, our one and only home, and make it a better place. A peaceful world should nurture diverse civilizations. A stable order should accommodate different systems. And a confident major country should be inclusive to diverse values. The most important thing that we learned from decades of China-U.S. exchanges is that our difference in social system does not prevent us from seeking common ground while shelving differences and pursuing win-win cooperation and peaceful co-existence.

Fourth, we hope that the United States will practice true multilateralism.

China has helped establish, contributed to and upheld the existing international system. We were the first country to sign the UN Charter. Some in the United States describe China as the only country able to challenge the international system in almost all respects. We absolutely disagree. China's development has been achieved within the current international system. Why would we challenge a system that serves our interests, or start all over again?

What is deeply unsettling is the backlash against multilateralism in recent years and the danger of a divided world. The previous U.S. administration willfully walked away from international organizations, commitments and responsibilities, seriously disrupting the existing international system. We welcome the Biden administration to return to multilateralism. That said, China believes that true multilateralism means openness, inclusiveness, rule of law, consultation, cooperation, and keeping pace with the times. Multilateralism should not be used to form new opposing blocs or exclusive circles. Some in the United States often talk about strengthening ""rules-based international order"". The question is: what rules? And who makes them? If it means the rules made by Western countries only, then they are made by only 12 percent of the world population, and they should not be the common rules for all. China's view is clear – we must uphold the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law. This represents the shared aspiration of all countries and true multilateralism in practice.

Fifth, we hope that the United States will not interfere in China's internal affairs.

Sovereignty and territorial integrity are a country's core interests. Like any other country, China has no room for compromise on such a major issue of principle. The United States should not repeatedly challenge China's rights and interests on issues related to Taiwan, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and at the same time expect China to cooperate with it on issues of its own concern.

The Taiwan question is the most important and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. Adhering to the one-China principle, opposing ""Taiwan independence"" and safeguarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is also in the strategic interest of the United States. Playing the ""Taiwan card"" is dangerous, like playing with fire. Reunification is the historic trend. We will continue to work with the greatest sincerity and utmost efforts to strive for peaceful reunification. At the same time, we firmly oppose any separatist activities for any form of ""Taiwan independence"". We hope that the United States will abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, and not send any wrong signals to the ""Taiwan independence"" elements, or try to challenge, still less cross, China's policy red line.

The Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion. They are about fighting violent terrorism, separatism and extremism. Faced with a grave situation of violent terrorism in Xinjiang a few years ago, the Chinese government acted to strike down on terrorist activities in accordance with law. It has taken a series of de-radicalization measures and resorted to education to remove the breeding ground for terrorism. These efforts have paid off. There hasn't been a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang for over four years. People of all ethnic groups now live a safe and happy life. The claims of the so-called ""genocide"" and ""forced labor"" are nothing but lies driven by political motives. During its war on terror, the United States regarded China as a partner and the two sides agreed to designate the ""East Turkistan Islamic Movement"" (ETIM) as a terrorist organization. Now the U.S. has dramatically changed its position, and announced that it would remove the ETIM from its list. Such double standards and willfulness made the international community wonder if the United States still has principles. We welcome American friends to visit Xinjiang to see for themselves what it is really like there, and not fall for lies or rumors.

With regard to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR enacted last year and this year's decision to improve Hong Kong's electoral system both serve to improve the system of One Country, Two Systems, ensure the sound and steady implementation of One Country, Two Systems, ""Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong"" and a high degree of autonomy, and achieve long-term security in Hong Kong. The revision of the electoral system is designed to implement the basic principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"", which was explicitly put forward by Mr. Deng Xiaoping before Hong Kong's return as the political safeguard for advancing One Country, Two Systems. Administration by patriots is also common political ethics and practices. As the central government's policies for administering Hong Kong have been steadily implemented on the ground, Hong Kong has seen a major shift from chaos to stability with its democratic system and legal environment further improved. The United States should respect the Chinese government's efforts to implement One Country, Two Systems.

Some in the United States also talk about the so-called ""coercive diplomacy"" by China. The truth is, China in history fell prey to foreign coercion, even aggression. ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" A long-running feature of China's foreign policy is that all countries are equal regardless of their size. We do not act in a coercive way, and we firmly oppose any country doing so. But China's national sovereignty and dignity are being coerced and undermined, we undoubtedly need to respond with reasonable and lawful actions to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests as well as international equity and justice. China never threatens other countries with the use of force, build military alliances, export ideology, incite troubles in other countries' doorsteps or meddle in their affairs. Neither has China ever started a trade war or wantonly gone after foreign companies. We are prepared to work with other countries against any act of coercion in the world.

Friends,

We hope that in developing bilateral relations, China and the United States will send out more confidence in this warm spring, plant more seeds of cooperation for the benefit of people in our two countries and beyond, and reap harvests of global stability and development. At this critical moment, we hope all of you will continue to speak out for objectivity and reason, and contribute your wisdom and strength to promoting China-U.S. cooperation and upholding world peace.

Thank you. Now I am ready to take your questions.",China
160421,Han Zheng Meets with U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry via Video Link,"On April 16, 2021, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Vice Premier Han Zheng met with visiting U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry via video link in Beijing.

Han Zheng expressed, climate change is a matter concerning the welfare of all mankind. China has implemented the national strategy of actively responding to climate change, acting as an important participant, contributor, and leader in terms of global ecological conservation. Last year, President Xi Jinping announced China's pledge to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and become carbon-neutral by 2060, as well as new measures to ramp up nationally determined contributions. China is firm in resolve and forceful in action in tackling climate change. We'll reach the above-mentioned goals in a down-to-earth manner.

Han Zheng pointed out, China and the United States, as the world's largest developing and developed country respectively, share a lot of common interests in tackling climate change. China attaches importance to carrying out dialogue and cooperation on climate change with the U.S. side. China welcomes the U.S. return to the Paris Agreement, and expects the U.S. side to uphold the Agreement, shoulder its due responsibilities and make due contributions. In responding to climate change, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should be followed. China is ready to work with the U.S. side to leverage respective strengths, maintain dialogue and cooperation, and work with all parties to jointly promote the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

Kerry said, the U.S.-China cooperation is of vital importance in responding to the global challenge of climate change, hailing China's tremendous efforts in this regard. The United States is willing to work with China to enhance communication, deepen cooperation, and speed up the implementation of the goals set in the Paris Agreement, to jointly contribute more to responding to the crisis of climate change.",China
130421,Li Keqiang Attends the Dialogue with U.S. Business Leaders,"On April 13, 2021, Premier Li Keqiang attended the virtual dialogue with U.S. business leaders in Ziguang Pavilion of Zhongnanhai leadership compound. Board chairmen and CEOs from the US-China Business Council and over 20 U.S. multinational companies attended the dialogue. Li Keqiang had interactive communication with them and answered their questions. Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and Chairman of the Paulson Institute Henry Paulson chaired the dialogue.

Li Keqiang said that promoting the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations is the common aspiration of both peoples as well as the international community. The two sides need to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state in the telephone conversation and uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, enhance dialogue and communication, expand practical cooperation, properly manage differences, and push China-U.S. relations towards overall stability.

Li Keqiang pointed out that as the world's largest developing country and the largest developed country, China and the U.S. both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. The essence of economic and trade relations between China and the U.S. is mutual benefit. Such a relationship benefits the two peoples as well as world peace, stability, development and prosperity. Last year, the trade between the two countries increased despite multiple shocks, which indicates that there are objective conditions and opportunities for cooperation between the two sides, and that economic and trade cooperation is needed by both sides. Problems that occur in cooperation should be resolved through cooperation. ""Decoupling"" does no good to either side and will hurt the world. He hopes that China and the U.S. can meet each other half-way, promote cooperation by making a bigger pie of common interests and safeguard the safety and stability of the industrial and supply chains.

Li Keqiang said that championing opening-up is China's fundamental policy and China's door to the outside world will only open wider. By fostering a new development paradigm, China will, on the one hand, keep tapping the potential of the domestic market and form a stable support for economic growth and employment, and on the other hand, further open up China's market of a population of 1.4 billion and continue to make China an important destination for foreign investment and a big market for the world. China will further open up, work toward a market-based and law-governed business environment that is up to international standards, and promote reforms to delegate power, streamline administration and optimize government services, ensuring a level playing field for both domestic and foreign enterprises. China welcomes the active participation of companies from the United States and around the world in its reform and opening-up, as well as its modernization process to realize mutual benefit and win-win results.

Li Keqiang also answered the questions raised by participating businessmen about COVID-19 prevention and control, climate change and people-to-people exchanges.

The U.S. representatives said that avoiding conflict and confrontation and putting bilateral relations back on a constructive track are in the common interests of both sides. Economic and trade relations are the cornerstone of bilateral ties. ""Decoupling"" will bring huge uncertainties, not only for the two countries, but also for the whole world. The U.S. business community supports the two sides in increasing mutual trust through communication, enhancing coordination and cooperation in areas including pandemic prevention and control, climate change, sustainable development and innovation, and resuming people-to-people exchanges as soon as possible. U.S. companies welcome progress made by China in the areas of opening-up and optimizing the business environment, feel optimistic about China's development prospects and opportunities, and are committed to the long-term trade and investment cooperation with China.

Wang Yi, He Lifeng and others also attended the dialogue.",China

Ma Zhaoxu said that considering the new changes in the Iranian nuclear situation, all parties need to increase the sense of urgency. The U.S. side should take concrete actions as soon as possible, and both the United States and Iran need to meet each other half way for the latter's return to compliance at an early date. China will continue to play a constructive role in bringing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action back on track.",China
200321,China Talks About China-U.S. High-level Strategic Dialogue,"On March 18 and 19, 2021 local time, a China-U.S. high-level strategic dialogue was held in Anchorage. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi and State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi received an interview with media following the end of the high-level strategic dialogue.

Yang Jiechi said, in the past two days, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and I had a long-time strategic communication with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The two sides had candid and constructive exchanges on their domestic and foreign policies and bilateral relations. The dialogue is helpful and conducive to enhancing mutual understanding though there are still some important differences between the two sides. China will resolutely safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests. No one can stop China from growing stronger. The communication aims at implementing the consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden in their telephone conversation. China hopes that the two sides will strengthen communication, exchange and dialogue in various fields. The two sides should handle China-U.S. relations in the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, so as to move forward the bilateral relationship on a sound and stable track.

Wang Yi said, the Chinese side comes to the dialogue with sincerity because dialogue is always better than confrontation. However, any dialogue has to be conducted with the spirits of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences, instead of one side unilaterally drawing up a list or gouging price. Both sides have many concerns. Some doubts can be eased through dialogue, while some long-existing problems can be managed through dialogue. The Chinese side also made it clear to the U.S. side that sovereignty and territorial integrity are major issues of principle. The U.S. side should not underestimate China's determination to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, nor should it underestimate the Chinese people's will to safeguard national dignity and legitimate rights and interests. China's attitude towards developing the China-U.S. relationship is clear and consistent. The Chinese side hopes that the United States will meet China halfway, and in particular, the two sides should respect each other's core interests and major concerns. It is upon that basis that the door for China-U.S. dialogue will be always open.",China
200321,Yang Jiechi and Wang Yi Hold China-U.S. High-level Strategic Dialogue with Antony Blinken and Jake Sullivan,"On March 18 and 19, 2021 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi and State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a China-U.S. high-level strategic dialogue with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Anchorage. The two sides conducted candid, in-depth, long-time and constructive communication on the domestic and foreign policies, China-U.S. relations and major international and regional issues of common concern. Both sides believe the dialogue is timely and helpful and deepens mutual understanding.

The Chinese side said, China came at the invitation of the U.S. side. On the eve of the Chinese New Year, President Xi Jinping held a successful telephone conversation with President Joe Biden and the two sides agreed to enhance communication, manage differences and expand cooperation, which is of great significance in guiding the growth of China-U.S. relations in the time to come. China's attendance to the high-level strategic dialogue at the invitation of the U.S. side in Anchorage is an important step to implement the consensus reached by the two heads of state in their phone talks, and the dialogue was decided by the two presidents personally. In the past few years, due to the irrational suppression of China's legitimate rights and interests, China-U.S. relations have encountered unprecedented difficulties. This situation has damaged the interests of both nations and taken its toll on world stability and development, and should not be allowed to continue. China is ready to work with the United States to enhance strategic communication, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, properly manage differences and push forward bilateral relations on the track of sound and stable development, so as to create benefits for the people in both countries and promote long-lasting peace and prosperity of the world.

The Chinese delegation emphasized that it is the choice of history and the Chinese people for the CPC to govern, and that China's development cannot be achieved without the leadership of the CPC, which is a high consensus among the Chinese people and a general view of the international community. The system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the system that best fits China's conditions and the secret to China's development. Practice has proved that the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the right path, and China will continue to march forward on that broad road. The governing status of the CPC and the security of China's socialist system should not be damaged, and that is a red line that should never be crossed. China's development goal is consistent and clear, which is to realize the two centenary goals and the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation through hard work. The fundamental purpose is to ensure a better life for all Chinese people, which is the starting point of all China's policies. China will ground its efforts in the new development stage, apply the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm, and achieve high-quality development. No one can deprive the Chinese people of their right to pursue a better life. China always attaches importance to the protection and promotion of human rights, and gives priority to improving people's well-being and promoting well-rounded human development. The socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics is all people's democracy and consultative democracy, whose core is the people being masters of the country. China will not impose its democratic system and values on other countries, and meanwhile will resolutely defend its own political system and values and oppose any attempt to use the human rights issue as a cover to attack and smear China or interfere in China's internal affairs. The fundamental goal of China's development is to fulfill people's aspirations for a better life at home and contribute through its own development to the development and progress of all humankind. China has no intention to interfere in the political system of the United States, or to challenge or replace its status and influence. The U.S. side should have a correct view of China's political system and development path, of China's major policies and principles, and of China's influence on the world. The leadership role of the CPC and the core status of the CPC's leader result from China's arduous practice and enjoy the wholehearted support of the 1.4 billion Chinese people. This collective will is rock-solid and unshakable.

The Chinese side noted out, China firmly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, adheres to independence, peaceful development, win-win cooperation, multilateralism, equity and justice, and continuously promotes the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. China will resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and national dignity, firmly oppose other countries' meddling in China's internal affairs, and independently decide its policies and positions in line with the fundamental interests of the Chinese people as well as people around the world, and on the basis of the merits of various issues. China itself is committed to the path of peaceful development, and hopes that other countries will also pursue a path of peaceful development, and that all countries will transcend their differences in social system, civilization and religion, and achieve peaceful coexistence and common prosperity. Win-win cooperation is an important principle of China's development and a golden rule in China's external relations. China has made its development achievements in an open environment, and will promote high-quality development in the next phase with greater openness. Multilateralism is an important cornerstone of the current international system. True multilateralism should uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect the basic norms governing international relations, the sovereignty of countries around the world, and the diversity of civilizations, and commit to the democracy in international relations. It should not be used as a cover to form cliques, turn back the wheel of history, incite division along ideological lines, or instigate confrontation between different groups. China is ready to work with the United States to uphold true multilateralism in multilateral mechanisms, represented by the United Nations, and provide more public goods with better quality for the international community. China consistently maintains that all countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal members of the international community, and that decisions should not be made by simply showing off strong muscles or waving big fists, nor should the big and the strong be allowed to bully the small and the weak. The voices of developing countries should be heard and their rights and interests protected. As the world's largest developing and developed country, China and the United States should join hands to deepen South-North cooperation, including cooperation in third-party markets for developing countries, and promote the realization of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.

China expressed, the essence of China-U.S. relations is mutual benefit rather than a zero-sum game. China and the United States are not doomed to pose a threat to each other, differences are no reason for confrontation between them, and neither side can afford the consequences of conflict and confrontation. China and the United States should trust rather than suspect each other, understand rather than blame each other, work with rather than obstruct each other, and ensure that they focus on dealing with their domestic priorities and achieving their respective development goals. The two countries can cooperate on three most pressing tasks facing the international community, namely fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling climate change and promoting world economic recovery. The two sides should also strengthen communication and coordination on major international and regional issues, eliminate interruptions to bilateral cultural and people-to-people exchanges, and make the cake of cooperation bigger, so as to deliver more benefits to the people in both countries and beyond. Meanwhile, cooperation should be two-way and mutually beneficial, and should address the concerns of both sides in a balanced way. The Chinese side has maintained a high degree of stability and continuity in its policy towards the United States, and China is committed to non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation with the United States, while firmly safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests. The two sides should follow the spirit of the Xi-Biden telephone conversation to keep communication channels open, restore normal dialogue and exchange mechanisms, carry out win-win cooperation, properly manage differences, and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation. The two countries have the responsibility, ability and wisdom to find a way for major countries with different political systems to get along with each other, which will be a historic contribution by China and the United States to human civilization.

The Chinese side pointed out, in the past few years, the previous U.S. administration went against the trend of the times, and carried out highly erroneous anti-China policies, which seriously damaged both China's interests and China-U.S. relations. China had to take legitimate and necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. China urges the U.S. side to eliminate the impact of the previous administration's wrong policy towards China and avoid new problems.

The Chinese side pointed out, the Taiwan question bears on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and concerns China's core interests, and there is no room for compromise and concession. China urges the U.S. side to abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, stop official exchanges and military contacts with and arms sales to Taiwan, and cease helping Taiwan expand its so-called ""international space"". The U.S. side should handle the Taiwan question in a careful and proper manner, and do not send wrong signals to ""Taiwan independence"" forces or try to cross China's bottom line, so as to prevent China-U.S. relations as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait from suffering serious damage.

The Chinese side pointed out, the electoral system in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is a local electoral system in China and its improvement is the prerogative of the central government of China, and how to design, develop and improve it is China's domestic affair. No foreign government, organization or individual has the right to interfere. Improving HKSAR's electoral system must follow the principle of ""patriots administering Hong Kong"". We urge the United States to abide by international law and the basic norms governing international relations, respect the decision of China's National People's Congress on improving Hong Kong's electoral system, and stop supporting ""Hong Kong independence"" forces. We call on the U.S. side to revoke illegal sanctions against Chinese officials and institutions, stop trying to mess up Hong Kong again, and cease obstructing China's implementation of ""one country, two systems"". If the United States continues to go its own way, China will make firm responses.

The Chinese side pointed out, the claim that there is genocide in China's Xinjiang is the biggest lie of the century. The Chinese side is ready to engage in exchanges with the U.S. side on the basis of mutual respect, and the door of Xinjiang is wide open to the world, but China will not accept any investigation in Xinjiang based on the presumption of guilt by those who are biased, condescending or behaving like a preacher. China hopes that the U.S. side can respect facts, call off attacks against and smearing of China's Xinjiang policy, and abandon double standards on counter terrorism.

The Chinese side pointed out, the 14th Dalai Lama is a political exile who has long been engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the guise of religion. China hopes that the U.S. side will abide by its commitment to recognizing Tibet as part of China and refraining from supporting ""Tibet independence"", carefully and properly handle Tibet-related issues, revoke sanctions against relevant Chinese officials, and cease exploiting Tibet-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs.

The two sides agreed to follow the spirit of the Xi-Biden telephone conversation on February 11, 2021 to maintain dialogue and communication, conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, avoid misunderstanding and misjudgment, forestall conflict and confrontation, and promote sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations.

Both sides expressed the hope to continue such type of high-level strategic communication.

Both sides are committed to enhancing dialogue and cooperation in the field of climate change, and they agreed to establish a joint working group on climate change.

The United States reiterated its adherence to the one-China policy on the Taiwan question.

The two sides discussed making reciprocal arrangements for the COVID-19 vaccination of each side's diplomats and consular officials.

They agreed to hold talks on facilitating activities of each other's diplomatic and consular missions and personnel, as well as on issues related to media reporters, in the spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit.

The two sides also discussed adjusting relevant travel and visa policies according to the pandemic situation, and gradually normalizing personnel exchanges between China and the United States.

They also exchanged views on a series of other topics, including economy and trade, military, law enforcement, culture, health, cyber security, climate change, the Iranian nuclear issue, Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula and Myanmar, and agreed to maintain and enhance communication and coordination.

The two sides will step up coordination and consultation on activities within such multilateral frameworks as the Group of 20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.",China

At the Opening of Lanting Forum on

Promoting Dialogue and Cooperation and Managing Differences: Bringing China-U.S. Relations Back to the Right Track

Beijing, 22 February 2021

Distinguished Guests,
Friends,

Good morning and good evening. During the Chinese Spring Festival season, visionary people from China and the United States are gathering at Lanting to discuss the future of China-U.S. relations. This is indeed very important. Let me begin by extending, on behalf of the Foreign Ministry, our New Year greetings to all the friends who have been caring for and supporting China-U.S. relations over the years.

As we bid farewell to winter and usher in spring, the change of seasons shows that the chills of winter will eventually melt away and the hopes of spring are just around the corner. Humanity must not lose confidence facing the unprecedented common challenges of the global pandemic, economic recession and climate change. We must stand up to them with courage, solidarity and responsibility. As two major countries, China and the United States should first take care of their own stuff and at the same time, they should also work together for the common good of humankind. This is the expectation of the international community and the due responsibility of major countries. On the Lunar New Year's eve, President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden had their first telephone call. President Xi underscored China's principled position that it is willing to work with the Unites States, in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, to focus on cooperation, manage differences, and promote sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations. The two Presidents had in-depth exchange of views at length, and agreed that the two countries should enhance mutual understanding and avoid misperception and miscalculation; they should treat each other with candor and sincerity and not seek conflict or confrontation; and they should unclog communication channels and facilitate exchange and cooperation. This very important phone call has oriented China-U.S. relations that had been struggling to ascertain its bearings at a crossroads. It has also sent out the first encouraging news of this spring for the two countries and the whole world.

Friends,

In the past few years, China-U.S. relations deviated from the normal track, and ran into the biggest difficulties since the establishment of diplomatic ties. The root cause was that the previous U.S. administration, out of its own political needs, seriously distorted China's future path and policy, and on that basis, took various measures to suppress and contain China, which inflicted immeasurable damage to bilateral relations. Today, to right the wrongs and bring the relationship back to the right track, the walls of misperceptions must be torn down first to clear the way for knowing, observing, and understanding China as it is.

China is a country that always upholds and promotes people's democracy. Over a long time, Western countries have either seriously distorted or misunderstood China on democracy. In fact, democracy is not a patent of a few countries. It is a common value of humanity. There are various ways to realize democracy, and there is no fixed model or standard answer. True democracy must be rooted in the realities of a country and serve its people. The socialist democracy practiced by China upholds the organic unity of the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance. It is a whole-process democracy. Important legislation and policy-making must go through set procedures and extensive discussions, and the final decision must be made on the basis of scientific and democratic deliberations. It is the most representative democracy where people's matters are widely consulted for the greatest common denominator that suits the will of the whole society. For example, when drafting the 14th Five-year Plan, the Chinese government placed importance on the views from various sectors, and collected over one million comments and recommendations from online channels alone. Facts have shown that China's socialist democracy embodies the will of the people and fits the country's realities. It is thus endorsed by the people, and has made special, important contributions to the progress of political civilization of humankind.

China is a country that is always committed to protecting and promoting human rights. As the largest developing country, China takes a people-centered approach to human rights. We believe that the rights to subsistence and development are basic human rights of paramount importance. At the same time, we strive for comprehensive and coordinated development of economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights. Over the past 70 plus years since the founding of the People's Republic, China's per capita GDP has risen from less than U.S.$30 to over U.S.$10,000. More than 800 million people have been lifted out of poverty. We have eliminated abject poverty for the first time in China's thousands years of history. Places inhabited by ethnic minorities, such as Xinjiang and Tibet, have stood out as shining examples of China's human rights progress.

In the past 60 years and more, Xinjiang's GDP expanded by over 200 times, with per capita GDP growing by nearly 40 times. And its average life expectancy increased from 30 to 72. In fighting COVID-19, we have made the utmost efforts to protect the right to life and health for each and every Chinese, and at all cost, we have curbed the spread of the virus in the fastest possible speed, and have done our best to raise the cure rate and lower the fatality rate. This has made it possible for the society and the economy to recover quickly.

China is a country that always values and safeguards world peace. China has benefited from world peace in its development, and has contributed to world peace in turn with its development. In the past 70 years and more, we didn't provoke any war or occupy one inch of foreign territory. We seek to settle differences through dialogue and resolve disputes through negotiation. We have no intention to export ideology. Nor do we attempt to overturn the government of any country. We always stay on the new path of state-to-state relations to seek dialogue instead of confrontation and teaming up instead of ganging up. We actively participate in the good offices on hotspot issues. China is the second largest contributor to the UN's regular budget and peacekeeping assessment. It is also the largest contributor of peacekeepers among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

China is a country that always advocates and pursues win-win cooperation. We take win-win cooperation as an important principle in our diplomacy. We believe in shared interests and common good. We help fellow developing countries with sincerity and good faith, and we do not attach political strings or impose our wills. In the past seven years since we launched the Belt and Road Initiative, China's trade in goods with partner countries surpassed U.S.$7.8 trillion, and direct investment in those countries topped U.S.$110 billion. All this has been helpful for local employment and economic growth. Despite the global economic recession, China has hosted international import expos for three years to share with other countries the Chinese market opportunities. At the moment, China is following the new development vision, fostering a new development paradigm featuring ""dual circulations"", with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other, and advancing opening-up at a higher level. This means a bigger market and more development opportunities for other countries.

China is a country that always practices and upholds multilateralism. China firmly believes in multilateralism. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of China's lawful seat at the United Nations. During these five decades, China has upheld the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, supported the UN in exercising its authority and playing its due role. We believe that all countries are equal, regardless of their size. And we firmly promote greater democracy in international relations. We never seek to form small circles targeted at other countries. We never take actions unilaterally outside the authorization by the UN. When unilateralism and protectionism ran amok in the last few years, China immediately stepped forward to resist the tendency, and took concrete actions to uphold the basic norms of international relations and safeguard the common interests of developing countries. As UN Secretary-General António Guterres put it, China has become a backbone of multilateralism and an indispensable and trustworthy force for world peace and development.

China now is in an epoch-making year. We will celebrate the centenary of the CPC. The American people have come to know about the CPC for at least 85 years since Edgar Snow visited Yan'an in 1936. From the revolution years to reform and opening-up, from completing the building of a moderately prosperous society to fully building a modern socialist country, the CPC is always committed to the eternal great cause of the Chinese nation. It is showing even stronger vigor and vitality at its 100th anniversary.

We know that the new U.S. administration is reviewing and assessing its foreign policy. We hope that U.S policy makers will keep pace with the time, see clearly the trend of the world, abandon biases, give up unwarranted suspicions, and move to bring the China policy back to reason to ensure a healthy and steady development of China-U.S. relations.

Friends,

How to bring China-U.S. relations back to the right track?

Fifty years ago, Dr. Henry Kissinger made the ice-breaking visit to China, and with extraordinary political resolve, leaders of China and the United States jointly reopened the door of interaction which had been closed for decades. Fifty years later today, we must, with the sense of responsibility for the two countries and the world, make once again the sensible and right decision. Here are some key points of China's position.

First, it is important to respect each other and not to interfere in each other's internal affairs. This is a basic norm governing international relations. A good-mannered gentleman never thrusts his knife and fork into the food on someone else's plate. Similarly, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"", a teaching by Confucius, is widely accepted around the world. For major countries like China and the United States, there is a greater need to respect each other, rather than being fixated on remodeling, suppressing or even defeating the other. Such attempts have not succeeded, and never will. They will only cause problems and even conflicts unnecessarily.

Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, China has all along respected the choices made by the American people, welcomed the strong growth momentum of the United States, and never interfered in its internal affairs. We have no intention to challenge or replace the United States. We are ready to have peaceful coexistence and seek common development with the United States. Likewise, we hope the United States will respect China's core interests, national dignity, and rights to development. We urge the United States to stop smearing the CPC and China's political system, stop conniving at or even supporting the erroneous words and actions of separatist forces for ""Taiwan independence"", and stop undermining China's sovereignty and security on internal affairs concerning Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet. Only with true mutual respect can China-U.S. relations achieve steady improvement and growth in the long run.

Second, it is important to step up dialogue and properly manage the differences. Given the differences between our two countries in social system, development stage, history and culture, it is natural for us to have disagreements. What is crucial is to enhance mutual understanding through dialogue and not allow our relations to be defined by disagreements. Over the past few years, the United States basically cut off bilateral dialogue at all levels. And this was one of the main reasons for the deterioration of China-U.S. relations.

At present, both sides should follow up on the phone call between the two Presidents on the eve of the Chinese New Year, act in the fundamental interests of the two peoples, take a forward-looking, open-minded and inclusive attitude, and reactivate or establish dialogue mechanisms in various areas and at various levels. The two sides should engage in candid dialogues on a broad range of issues in bilateral relations and on major regional and international issues, so as to get a clear understanding of each other's policy intentions, sort out the critical issues in China-U.S. relations, and explore effective ways to manage sensitive issues, ward off risks and remove obstacles. China is, as always, open to dialogue. We stand ready to have candid communication with the U.S. side, and engage in dialogues aimed at solving problems.

Third, it is important to move in the same direction to restart mutually beneficial cooperation. Both countries gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. This has been proved time and again by history and by practices since the diplomatic relationship was established. With regional hotspot issues and global challenges emerging one after another, areas for China-U.S. cooperation are expanding rather than shrinking, and the prospects for interaction are broadening rather than narrowing. More than ever China and the United States are more capable of getting big things done to the benefit of the two countries and the world at large.

Under the current circumstances, the two sides may start from easier things, interact actively, and build up goodwill. Economic cooperation and trade is an important part of China-U.S. relations. Despite COVID-19, two-way trade expanded last year against headwinds, reflecting the win-win nature and intrinsic vitality of bilateral trade ties. China welcomes greater success of U.S. businesses in China, and will continue to take effective measures to improve our business environment. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. side will adjust its policies as soon as possible, among others, remove unreasonable tariffs on Chinese goods, lift its unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and research and educational institutes, and abandon irrational suppression of China's technological progress, so as to create necessary conditions for China-U.S. cooperation. COVID-19, climate change and world economic recovery are the three most pressing tasks for the international community. As a major responsible country, China is ready to coordinate policies and work with the United States in these three areas for the good of the whole world.

Fourth, it is important to clear the path for the resumption of bilateral exchanges in all areas. Over the past 40-odd years of diplomatic relations, various sectors of the two countries have forged deep bonds. There are 50 pairs of sister provinces/states and 232 pairs of sister cities. China had been the biggest source of international students in the United States for ten years in a row. However, these normal exchanges were seriously disrupted in the past few years. The number of Chinese visitors to the United States, either for exchange programs or study, had plummeted. The social foundation of bilateral relations was ""poisoned"", which should not be allowed to happen in the first place.

People-to-people friendship holds the key to state-to-state relations. The Chinese and American peoples enjoy a long-standing friendship, which should stay immune to the ups and downs in the political dimension of the relations. The late Professor Ezra Vogel, a prominent China scholar, called for a rational China policy till the last days of his life. He co-authored the open letter, entitled ""China is not an enemy"", and it was co-signed by many well-known people. We hope that the U.S. side will act as early as possible to lift its restrictions on Chinese educational and cultural groups, media outlets and institutions for overseas Chinese affairs in the United States, remove its obstructions for U.S. subnational governments and social sectors to engage with China, and encourage and support the resumption of normal exchange programs between universities, research institutes and of students. China is ready to work with the United States with an open mind to build a good environment for people-to-people exchanges.

Friends,

In the final analysis, the future of China-U.S. relationship is in the hands of the two peoples. Its improvement always requires support of the two societies. I sincerely hope that today's Lanting Forum will be a platform for candid discussions and consensus building as well as a source of vision, insight and wisdom for a better China-U.S. relationship. I hope that the two sides will work together to steer the giant ship of China-U.S. relations back to the course of sound development toward a bright future with boundless prospects.

Thank you!",China
110221,Xi speaks with Biden on phone,"On Feb. 11, 2021, the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year, President Xi Jinping  had a phone conversation with U.S. President Joseph R. Biden.

The two presidents wished each other good fortune in the Year of the Ox, and had an in-depth exchange of views on China-U.S. relations and major international and regional issues.

Biden conveyed festive greetings to the Chinese people and wished the Chinese people a happy and prosperous New Year. Xi congratulated Biden once again on taking office as U.S. president, and wished the people of China and the United States a happy and auspicious Year of the Ox.

Xi pointed out that the restoration and growth of China-U.S. relations has been the most important development in international relations over the past half century and more.

Despite various twists and difficulties, he added, the relationship has on the whole kept moving forward and delivered enormous benefits to the Chinese and American peoples and contributed to global peace, stability and prosperity.

Xi stressed that China and the United States both gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation; cooperation is the only right choice for both sides.

When China and the United States work together, they can accomplish a great deal for the good of both countries and the world at large; confrontation between the two countries, however, will definitely be disastrous for both countries and the world, he added.

Emphasizing that the China-U.S. relationship is currently at an important juncture, Xi said it is the common desire of both peoples and the wider international community to see the sound and stable development of China-U.S. relations.

""You have said that America can be defined in one word: Possibilities. We hope the possibilities will now point toward an improvement of China-U.S. relations,"" Xi said to Biden.

The two countries, he suggested, should make joint efforts in the same direction, follow the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focus on cooperation, manage their differences, and work for the sound and stable development of China-U.S. relations.

In this way, they can deliver more tangible benefits to people in both countries, and make their due contribution to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, promoting world economic recovery and maintaining regional peace and stability, Xi added.

Xi emphasized that while the two sides may differ on some issues, it is crucial to show mutual respect, treat each other as equals, and properly manage and handle the differences in a constructive fashion.

The foreign affairs departments of the two countries may have in-depth communications on wide-ranging matters in the bilateral relationship and major international and regional issues, and the economic, financial, law enforcement and military authorities of the two countries may also have more contacts, Xi said.

The two sides should re-establish the various dialogue mechanisms, read each other's policy intentions accurately, and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation, he said, adding that it is important to manage differences where they exist and jointly pursue cooperation where it is desirable to do so.

The Taiwan question and issues relating to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, etc. are China's internal affairs and concern China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the U.S. side should respect China's core interests and act prudently, Xi stressed.

Xi emphasized that confronting a highly uncertain international situation, China and the United States shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.

The two sides, he added, should act to conform to the trend of the world, jointly safeguard peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and make historic contributions to promoting world peace and development.

Biden, for his part, noted that China has a long history and a great culture and the Chinese people are a great people.

The United States and China must avoid conflict and they may work together on climate change and many other issues, he added.

The U.S. side, he said, is prepared to have candid and constructive dialogue with the Chinese side in the spirit of mutual respect and to improve mutual understanding and avoid miscommunication and miscalculation.

The two presidents agreed that their phone conversation today will send a positive signal to the world and the two sides will maintain close communication on China-U.S. relations and issues of mutual interest.",China
020221,Dialogue with National Committee on U.S.-China Relations,"It is a pleasure to have this virtual conversation with board members of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. You all are leading figures with important influence representing different sectors of the American society, including key members of previous administrations, accomplished business leaders, and well-known scholars in the strategic community. I look forward to a deep-going discussion with you all on China-U.S. relations and matters of shared interest.

The National Committee has witnessed and contributed to the growth of China-U.S. relations. It played a prominent role in ping-pong diplomacy by hosting the Chinese table tennis team on their first visit to the United States. In its 55-year history, the National Committee has made a valuable contribution to promoting the mutual understanding, exchanges and cooperation between the Chinese and the American people. We commend your great efforts. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Dr. Henry Kissinger's secret visit to China. I wish to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to Dr. Kissinger and other friends for your long-lasting efforts to promote the friendship, mutual trust, cooperation and broader bilateral relations between our two countries.

In 2020, the world was caught by the sudden attack of COVID-19. While the pandemic is thought-provoking, the most important thing is that in the era of globalization, the interests of countries are so intertwined that solidarity and enhanced coordination and cooperation are the only way for us to tackle global challenges effectively and create a better future for all. China and the United States are the two largest economies and permanent members of the UN Security Council. Effective cooperation between the two has a direct bearing on the well-being of all people as well as peace, development and prosperity of the world.

For the past few years, the Trump administration adopted misguided policies against China, plunging the relationship into its most difficult period since the establishment of diplomatic ties. Some in the United States, sticking to Cold War thinking, perceived China as a threat. Their rhetoric and actions have interfered in China's internal affairs, undermined China's interests, and disrupted exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides. There have also been attempts to seek ""decoupling"" and a so-called ""new Cold War"". Such moves, going against the trend of the times, have seriously damaged China-U.S. relations as well as the fundamental interests of the two peoples.

We believe that peace and development are still the prevailing trend of the times, and that peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation remain the shared aspiration of all peoples. China calls for establishing a new type of international relations characterized by mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation, and for building a community with a shared future for mankind. This is both our vision and our guide for action. It must be pointed out that the 1.4 billion Chinese people wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and they are rallying closely around the CPC and forging ahead on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics with great resolve and determination. No force could stop China's continuous development or the noble cause of global peace and development.

It is good to note that in times of great difficulty for China-U.S. relations, the force for bilateral exchanges and cooperation has never been absent. A great number of institutions, groups and individuals in the United States, including the National Committee, have made their voices heard and their views known through co-signed letters, articles and webinars. A strong case is made for cooperation instead of confrontation between China and the United States. Such voices of reason, in stark contrast with the noise and disruption from China hawks, are most valuable for upholding overall stability of China-U.S. relations.

The year 2020 has been a most extraordinary one. In the trying times of the sudden onslaught of COVID-19, the Chinese and American people reached out to each other. A great number of local governments, businesses, civil groups and individuals in the United States gave their valuable support to China. From the Chinese side, many provinces, cities, companies, institutions and ordinary people pitched in, among other things, by facilitating U.S. purchases of Chinese medical supplies. Video clips recorded by Chinese and American youngsters cheering for one another warmed all our hearts. As quoted from letters of appreciation by U.S. states and cities, the mutual assistance and support between the two sides in this difficult time were instrumental to our joint fight to bring the virus under control.

""Mountains do not meet, but people do."" The communication and friendship between the Chinese and American people can never be stopped. Despite the many obstacles, our bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields have registered new progress. With another four pairs of sister cities established last year, China and the United States now have 50 pairs of sister provinces and states and 231 pairs of sister cities. According to the Member Survey conducted by the U.S.-China Business Council last year, 91 percent of the U.S. companies surveyed showed that their China operations were profitable and 87 percent of the companies reported no plans to shift production out of China. The fact is, our two countries' economic cooperation and trade have continued to grow against the headwinds. In 2020, two-way trade in goods grew by more than 8 percent to over 580 billion dollars, including over 130 billion dollars of Chinese imports from the United States, up by nearly 10 percent.

A review of history and reality points to one thing: cooperation between China and the United States is desired by the people in both countries, and such a popular trend cannot be reversed. Between China and the United States, there are so many shared and interconnected interests. Those who seek to disrupt bilateral ties are driven by political gains and narrow-minded prejudice. They will be standing on the wrong side of history and alienating themselves from people in both countries. And their attempts will never get anywhere.

In the past year, the Chinese people, working as one under the leadership and instruction of President Xi Jinping, made major strategic progress in both COVID response and economic and social development. Historic achievements were made in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and decisive victory was won in ending extreme poverty nation-wide. The year 2021 marks the centenary of the Communist Party of China. It is also the first year in our implementation of the 14th Five-Year Plan, a year in which China will embark on a new journey toward building a modern socialist country. As China enters a new development stage, we will fully apply the new development vision and foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. The next five years will see China embracing high-quality development.

I know many of you are familiar with China's momentous journey since reform and opening-up started over four decades ago, and you know the country well from your visits to China at different times in the past. Opening-up has been a key driving force behind China's rapid development. We remain fully committed to this fundamental policy and there will be no wavering in our commitment. What has happened over the past 40-plus years proves that reform and opening-up is a win-win process. It has brought benefits not only to China, but also to the United States and the world beyond. On 17 January 2017, President Xi Jinping stated at the World Economic Forum that China's development is an opportunity for the world. China is committed to a path of pursuing common development through opening-up. While developing itself, China has shared much of the fruit of its development with other countries and peoples and lent much momentum to an open world economy. On 25 January this year, President Xi Jinping stressed at the World Economic Forum's ""Davos Agenda"" virtual event that China will continue to implement a win-win strategy of opening-up and is committed to following through on its fundamental policy of opening-up. China will foster a business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standards, and will unleash the potential of the huge China market and domestic demand, so as to give further impetus to global economic recovery and growth. President Xi's important remarks have sent a positive signal that China remains committed to deepening reform and pursuing greater opening-up at a higher level. They also speak volumes about China's strong commitment to achieving common prosperity with the rest of the world. As China's economy grows, the Chinese people naturally want to lead a better life. This will mean more demand for a greater variety of quality products, technologies and services from other countries. In the coming decade, total import into China is expected to top 22 trillion dollars. This, I believe, will be a strong boost to foreign companies, including American companies, as they pursue innovation and business opportunities. It also means an ever growing market for other countries around the world.

More than a week ago, the Biden administration officially took office. China-U.S. relations now stand at a key moment and face new opportunities and new challenges. People in the two countries and beyond are watching closely as to where this relationship is heading. It is a task for both China and the United States to restore the relationship to a predictable and constructive track of development, and to build a model of interaction between the two major countries that focuses on peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation. This, I believe, also answers to the expectation of countries in the global community.

The Chinese government takes a stable and consistent policy toward the United States. China is prepared to work with the United States to move the relationship forward along the track of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation for the well-being of both countries and peoples. In the meantime, we will continue to stand firm as we defend our sovereignty, security and development interests. We hope the new administration will respond to the will of both peoples and follow the trend of history. By focusing on cooperation and managing differences together, the two sides will be able to return the relationship to the course of sound and steady development. For that to happen, I believe the following are most important:

First, China should be seen as it is. The previous administration has pursued some misguided policies towards China. The root cause, I would say, is a strategic misjudgment by some in the United States - they view China as a major strategic competitor, even an adversary. That, I am afraid, is historically, fundamentally and strategically wrong. China's development is essentially about bettering the lives of its people. China is committed to the path of peaceful development, a win-win strategy of opening-up, and a development that is shared by all countries, the United States included. We will work with other countries to deliver a better future for all. That said, I need to point out that no one is in the position to deny the Chinese people their right to a better life. The development of China is a process that no force can ever hold back. The growth of China-U.S. relations has fully demonstrated that our two countries can and must cooperate and coordinate with each other more closely for our common good. That is also what the world expects from us. We in China hope that the United States will rise above the outdated mentality of zero-sum, major-power rivalry and work with China to keep the relationship on the right track.

Second, normal interactions need to be restored. The growth of China-U.S. relations is the result of decades of commitment and dedication by Chinese and Americans from all sectors to maintaining engagement, exchange, communication and cooperation. It is not something to be taken for granted. For normal exchanges to resume, our two sides have to work in the same direction. At the government level, our embassies and other channels should serve as bridges. Other players including think tanks, universities, media organizations, and businesses as well as exchanges at the sub-national level can also contribute in their own ways to bolstering the overall relations. I hope that the new administration will remove the stumbling blocks to people-to-people exchanges, like harassing Chinese students, restricting Chinese media outlets, shutting down Confucius Institutes and suppressing Chinese companies. These policy measures are not only wrong but also unpopular. Instead, more should be done to send a positive message of China and the United States working together, to encourage a positive public perception of each other and win more public support for growing our relations.

Third, proper management of differences is called for. As two big countries with different histories, cultures and systems, China and the United States may disagree on some issues. What matters is that we manage our differences properly so that they do not stand in the way of our overall relations. Both sides need to respect each other's histories, cultures and traditions, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and respect each other's choices of political system and development path. China never meddles in the internal affairs of the United States, including its elections. China never exports its development model or seeks ideological confrontation. China has no intention to challenge or replace the U.S. position in the world, or to carve out a sphere of influence. Likewise, we expect the United States to honor its commitment under the three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqués, strictly abide by the One China principle, and respect China's position and concerns on the Taiwan question. The United States should stop interference in the affairs of Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang, which all matter to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stop attempts to hold back China's development by meddling in China's internal affairs. History and reality have shown time and again that these issues concern China's core interests, national dignity, as well as the sentiments of its 1.4 billion people. They constitute a redline that must not be crossed. Any trespassing would end up undermining China-U.S. relations and the United States' own interests. We in China hope that the U.S. side will fully understand the sensitivity of these issues and handle them with prudence, so as to avoid disruption or damage to mutual trust and cooperation.

Fourth, mutually beneficial cooperation ought to be broadened. As President Xi Jinping has pointed out on multiple occasions, China and the United States working together can make great things happen not just for the two countries but for the world at large. In the face of COVID-19, there are more and broader areas where China and the United States can and must cooperate. COVID response, economic recovery and climate change, among others, could become promising areas of cooperation for China and the United States. We could also discuss ways to jointly improve the global public health system. Those few U.S. politicians should immediately stop using the pandemic to stigmatize China. Instead, they should do things that will contribute to an enabling environment for bilateral cooperation against COVID-19.

On trade, China emphasizes that trade issues should not be politicized, and the concept of ""national security"" should not be abused. China will always welcome U.S. business investment in China, and it falls on both sides to provide a fair, open and non-discriminatory environment for each other's companies. Better growth prospects in the world's two biggest economies will bring greater benefits to our two peoples and the rest of the world. China is ready for closer macroeconomic policy coordination and more cooperation with the United States to keep the global industrial and supply chains safe and maintain global economic and financial stability. Such efforts would certainly help revive economic growth in our two countries and the world as a whole.

On climate change, China is committed to following a new development philosophy and delivering its pledges under the Paris Agreement. China has announced its goals of striving to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. For China and the United States, climate change, renewable energy and low-carbon, sustainable development could be areas of mutually beneficial cooperation, which I believe will serve economic and social development in our countries and help protect Mother Earth.

There should be closer exchanges and cooperation between our militaries and in law enforcement, drug control and cyber security, and more communication and coordination on regional hotspot issues and on major global challenges such as poverty reduction through development, counterterrorism and nonproliferation. Together, we could provide more public goods to the world. We could also strengthen cooperation at the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the G20, APEC and other multilateral fora to enhance global governance and promote a globalization process that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.

The history of China-U.S. relations gives us reason to be optimistic about a brighter future for China-U.S. relations. We need to bear in mind the fundamental interests of people in our two countries and beyond. We need to respect each other, seek common ground while putting aside differences, keep disagreements under effective control, and expand common interests. If we follow this approach, I am convinced that the China-U.S. relationship will embark on a path of improvement and development, a prospect that would benefit our two peoples and the entire world tremendously. We will count on the National Committee, all of its board members, and indeed Americans from all walks of life to continue playing your positive role and contributing your wisdom and strength to the sound and steady growth of China-U.S. relations.

Thank you.",China
280121,Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng: Anything is Possible When China and the United States Choose to Cooperate,"On January 28, 2021, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng attended and addressed the virtual Vision China event with the theme ""Moving Forward: The Future of China-U.S. Relations"" organized by China Daily.

Le Yucheng said, as the new year has begun, and a new U.S. administration was just sworn in, it is particularly timely and meaningful to explore the future of China-U.S. relations. Last year was extremely challenging. The world was hit by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, and China-U.S. relations suffered the worst setback of the last forty years. He hopes that the new year of 2021 will bring a new start to the world and to China-U.S. relations.

Le Yucheng said, this year marks the 50th anniversary of Dr. Kissinger's historic visit to China as well as the famous ""ping-pong diplomacy"". It took those great men before us extraordinary wisdom and courage to break the ice in China-U.S. relations. The challenges we face today call for the same vision and courage to break the ice again.

President Joe Biden has visited China a total of four times, and has a better knowledge of China. He first visited China as a young Senator in 1979 and met with Mr. Deng Xiaoping. It was the same year the two countries normalized bilateral relations. Le Yucheng said that he was especially impressed by President Joe Biden's repeated appeal to the American people for unity over division in his inauguration speech. This is exactly the same spirit and attitude for China-U.S. relations.

Le Yucheng stated that the real enemy of the United States is COVID-19, not China. The Trump administration's misguided China policy in the past four years has been a harsh lesson which taught us that China and the United States, as two major countries in the world, should treat each other as partners rather than adversaries, help rather than fight each other, and lead with the power of example rather than the example of power, in face of such common challenges for mankind as COVID-19.

Le Yucheng stressed that in his congratulatory message to then President-elect Joe Biden, President Xi Jinping stated that China and the United States should act ""in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, so as to focus on cooperation, manage differences, move the relationship forward in a sound and steady manner and, together with other countries and the international community, advance the noble cause of world peace and development."" This is China's vision and expectation for China-U.S. relations, which also charts the course for the future development of the bilateral relations.

Le Yucheng summarized his four-point expectation for the future development of China-U.S. relations by quoting four ""R"" words.

The first R is ""respect"". It is not a difficult starting point to show mutual respect between the two countries. China has stated repeatedly that it has no intention to challenge or replace the United States. We don't even think the relationship should be defined by ""competition"", because we keep challenging ourselves, not the United States. The only thing that China asks of the United States is to respect the development path we have chosen, respect our legitimate interests, and respect our pursuit for a better life, and to quit its obsession with changing or splitting China. The world would be better off if our two countries would respect and help each other succeed.

The second R is ""reversal"". The last four years' journey of the China-U.S. relationship has seen too many ""traps"" of mistrust, ""pitfalls"" of division and ""poison"" of hatred. It is imperative to reverse the wrong course. He agrees with American friends' suggestion that both sides take small steps first to create conditions for improving the relationship. But we have to act now to bring China-U.S. relations back on track.

The third R is ""renewal"". China and the U.S. are different, but our shared interests and needs for cooperation far outweigh our differences. China believes COVID-19, economic recovery and climate change could be priority areas for cooperation for the near term. The Chinese people empathize with the American plight under COVID-19. China will continue to support the U.S. COVID response, increase experience-sharing on diagnostics and treatment, and work more closely with the United States on the research, production and distribution of vaccines. China will also enhance macroeconomic policy coordination with the United States to help global economic recovery. China is ready to renew cooperation with the United States. Our closer results-oriented cooperation on clean energy, low-carbon technologies, and environmental protection will go a long way toward protecting Mother Earth.

The fourth R is ""responsibility"". As two major countries in the world, China and the United States should shoulder important responsibilities for world peace and development. Our choice and action today will have far-reaching impact on the future of our world. Our two countries enjoyed successful cooperation in the past: jointly fighting terrorism in 2001, tackling the global financial crisis in 2008, combating Ebola in 2014, and collaborating on the Paris Agreement in 2016. History has taught us that working together, we could get great things done to the benefit of the two countries and the world. Anything is possible when China and the United States choose to cooperate.

He concluded his speech with a quote from Shakespeare: ""It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves."" He said that China and the United States can work together to avoid the so-called Thucydides Trap. There is no predestined fate for the world. The future of China-U.S. relations and the future of the world depend on what vision we embrace and what choice we make.

Vision China, which was launched in 2018, has been held for 17 sessions so far. This event was held online.",China
280121,Anything is Possible When China and the United States Choose to Cooperate,"Ladies and Gentlemen,
Friends,

Good to see you all here. I would like to thank China Daily for providing us with this important opportunity for discussion. As the new year has begun, and a new U.S. administration was just sworn in, it is particularly timely and meaningful for us to gather here to explore the future of China-U.S. relations.

Last year was extremely challenging. The world was hit by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, and China-U.S. relations suffered the worst setback of the last forty years. Despite all these, as a Chinese proverb says, ""Every new year brings new beginnings and possibilities."" I sincerely hope that the new year of 2021 will bring a new start to the world and to China-U.S. relations.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of Dr. Kissinger's historic visit to China as well as the famous ""ping-pong diplomacy"". And as the story of ""the tiny ball moved the big ball"" goes, it took those great men before us extraordinary wisdom and courage to break the ice in China-U.S. relations. The challenges we face today call for the same vision and courage to break the ice again.

Today I would like to pay tribute to the memory of Professor Ezra Vogel who passed away recently. Professor Vogel always approached the study of China, his lifelong passion, from a willingness to ""respect, understand and communicate"". Even in his final days, he urged the Trump administration to adopt a rational policy toward China. He co-authored the open letter ""China is not an enemy"" which was signed by more than one hundred distinguished scholars. It is visionaries like Professor Vogel and many others who give us confidence and hope even in the low point of our relations.

President Joe Biden has visited China a total of four times, and has a better knowledge of China. He first visited China as a young Senator in 1979 and met with Mr. Deng Xiaoping. It was the same year the two countries normalized bilateral relations. I read his inauguration speech with great interest, and was especially impressed by his repeated appeal to the American people for unity over division. I believe we need exactly the same spirit for China-U.S. relations.

In my interview with NBC last year, I said the real enemy of the United States is COVID-19, not China. We are saddened by the loss of over 400,000 American lives to COVID-19, even more than the number of Americans lost in World War Two. I can not stop thinking about what could have been done differently. Had the Trump administration chosen science and cooperation over scapegoating and political games, how many lives could have been saved?

The Trump administration's misguided China policy in the past four years has proven an utter failure in meeting the common challenge like COVID-19. We should learn an important lesson from such failure. China and the United States, as two major countries in the world, should treat each other as partners rather than adversaries, help rather than fight each other, and, as the Americans like to say, ""lead with the power of example rather than the example of power"".

In his congratulatory message to then President-elect Joe Biden, President Xi Jinping stated that China and the United States should act ""in the spirit of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, so as to focus on cooperation, manage differences, move the relationship forward in a sound and steady manner and, together with other countries and the international community, advance the noble cause of world peace and development."" President Xi's vision is clear. The direction and path forward is also clear. Please allow me to explain this vision by quoting four ""R"" words.

The first R is ""respect"". Mutual respect is the foundation for successful people-to-people and state-to-state interactions. It is not a difficult starting point. China has stated repeatedly that it has no intention to challenge or replace the United States. We don't even think the relationship should be defined by ""competition"", because we keep challenging ourselves, not the United States. The only thing that China asks of the United States is to respect the development path we have chosen, respect our legitimate interests, and respect our pursuit for a better life, and to quit its obsession with changing or splitting China. The world would be better off if our two countries would respect and help each other succeed.

The second R is ""reversal"". The last four years' journey of our relationship has seen too many ""traps"" of mistrust, ""pitfalls"" of division and ""poison"" of hatred. Enough is enough. We must act without further delay to reverse the wrong course. A lot of repair has to be done. I agree with American friends' suggestion that both sides take small steps first to create conditions for improving the relationship. But we have to act now to bring China-U.S. relations back on track.

The third R is ""renewal"". Yes, our two countries are different, but our shared interests and needs for cooperation far outweigh our differences. We believe COVID-19, economic recovery and climate change could be priority areas for cooperation for the near term. The Chinese people empathize with the American plight under COVID-19. We will continue to support the U.S. COVID response, increase experience-sharing on diagnostics and treatment, and work more closely with the United States on the research, production and distribution of vaccines. We will also enhance macroeconomic policy coordination with the United States to help global economic recovery. On climate change, an issue essential to the future of humanity, China is ready to renew cooperation with the United States. Our closer results-oriented cooperation on clean energy, low-carbon technologies, and environmental protection will go a long way toward protecting Mother Earth.

The fourth R is ""responsibility"". As the Chinese proverb goes, ""A bigger boat is meant to carry more weight."" Likewise, American people believe that ""responsibilities gravitate to the person who can shoulder them."" As two major countries in the world, China and the United States should shoulder important responsibilities for world peace and development. Our choice and action today will have far-reaching impact on the future of our world. Our two countries enjoyed successful cooperation in the past: jointly fighting terrorism in 2001, tackling the global financial crisis in 2008, combating Ebola in 2014, and collaborating on the Paris Agreement in 2016. History has taught us that working together, we could get great things done to the benefit of the two countries and the world. In other words, anything is possible when China and the United States choose to cooperate.

I want to conclude with a quote from Shakespeare: ""It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves."" China and the United States can work together to avoid the so-called Thucydides Trap. There is no predestined fate for the world. The future of China-U.S. relations, and the future of the world, depend on what vision we embrace and what choice we make.
