110725,Wang Yi Meets with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand,"On July 11, 2025, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand in Kuala Lumpur at the latter's request.

Wang Yi noted that this year marks the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Canada and the 20th anniversary of the establishment of their strategic partnership. It is an important opportunity to review the past and think about the future. Last month, Premier Li Qiang had a positive and constructive phone call with Prime Minister Mark Carney. Prime Minister Carney proposed to recalibrate China-Canada relations and carry out more exchanges and cooperation, to which the Chinese side expressed agreement.

Wang Yi emphasized that China-Canada relations have experienced ups and downs over the past few years. The merits of the issues involved are quite clear. There are no territorial disputes or geopolitical conflicts between China and Canada, and they can fully become partners that help each other succeed. The two sides should further deliver on the important common understandings reached by the two heads of government, view each other with a more objective and rational attitude, and strengthen cooperation with a more proactive and open spirit. China opposes overstretching the concept of national security to suppress Chinese companies groundlessly and hopes that Canada will provide a favorable business environment for the investment and operation of Chinese enterprises.

Wang Yi said that the abuse of tariffs by the United States undermines the international economic and trade order and drags down global economic growth. The United States has even imposed high tariffs on small and poor countries. In contrast, China upholds multilateralism and free trade, voluntarily offers zero-tariff treatment for 100 percent of products from the least developed countries, and promotes the common modernization of all countries by sharing development opportunities. In the face of a complex international situation, all countries should adhere to the basic norms governing international relations based on the United Nations Charter, uphold the principle of equality among nations regardless of size, refrain from interfering in internal affairs, and maintain peaceful coexistence among nations. Major countries, in particular, should take the lead and abandon the so-called logic of power politics that advocates ""peace through strength"".

Anita Anand said that Canada attaches importance to developing relations with China. The successful phone call between the two heads of government marks a positive step towards getting bilateral relations back on track and lays a foundation for expanding practical cooperation. The new Canadian government is committed to achieving diversification of the supply chain, enhancing the resilience of economic development, and benefiting the Canadian people. The Canadian side is ready to maintain contact and candid communication with the Chinese side, and accelerate the resumption of exchanges and cooperation in various fields such as economy, trade, health and culture with a pragmatic and constructive attitude."
190425,Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu Hold Talks with Deputy Foreign Minister of Canada David Morrison,"On April 19, 2024, Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu held talks with visiting Deputy Foreign Minister of Canada David Morrison. The two sides had an exchange of views on China-Canada relations and other issues of mutual interest and concern."
110125,Wang Yi Has a Phone Call with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly,"On January 11, 2024, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone call with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly at the latter's request.

Wang Yi said that both China and Canada are countries with important influence in the Asia-Pacific region. The two countries have neither historical rows nor realistic conflicts of interest, and share many common interests and enjoy complementary advantages. The current challenging China-Canada relationship is not what China desires, nor is caused by China, while China is open to maintaining contact and dialogue with Canada.

Wang Yi put forward three points on improving and developing China-Canada relations:

First, correct cognition. The root cause of the downturn of China-Canada relations in recent years is the serious deviation of the Canadian side's perception of China. China hopes that the Canadian side can objectively, rationally and correctly interpret China's domestic and foreign policies. China neither exports ideology nor challenges the international order, but has consistently upheld the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the international system with the UN at its core and the international order based on international law. At the same time, China must firmly safeguard its own sovereignty, security and development interests and never allow the Chinese people to be deprived of their legitimate rights to development.

Second, mutual respect. The differences in social systems and ideologies between China and Canada stem from their respective histories, cultures, national conditions and people's choices. The two sides should respect each other, engage in dialogue on an equal footing, increase trust, dispel misgivings and strengthen communication responsibly and constructively, so as not to let differences dominate bilateral relations. The Canadian side should earnestly implement its commitment to the one-China policy, preserve the political foundation of China-Canada relations, and not send any wrong signal to the ""Taiwan independence"" separatist forces.

Third, win-win cooperation. China will continue to expand high-standard opening-up, and Chinese modernization will surely bring important development opportunities to Canada and other countries in the world. As promoters and beneficiaries of free trade, China and Canada should jointly oppose the politicization and pan-security of economic issues and create a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for business development.

Mélanie Joly said, sound and stable Canada-China relations serve the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples. Despite the difficulties in bilateral relations, Canada is willing to bring bilateral relations back to the right track with a more open, practical and constructive attitude, and is willing to strengthen communication and dialogue with China, promote personnel exchanges, deepen economic and trade cooperation, and maintain close coordination and cooperation on environmental protection, biodiversity and international and regional issues."
180224,Wang Yi Meets with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly at the Latter's Request,"On February 17, 2024 local time, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly at the latter's request on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

Wang Yi said that China-Canada relations have long been at the forefront of China's relations with Western countries, and the current difficult situation is not what China wants to see. It is in the fundamental interests of both countries to promote the stabilization of China-Canada relations from further deterioration and achieve the improvement and development of bilateral relations. The economies of China and Canada are highly complementary and there is no conflict of fundamental interests between the two sides. The two sides are not rivals, let alone enemies, and should be partners of cooperation. As China and Canada differ in system, history and culture, the two sides should respect and learn from each other to expand consensus and rebuild trust to achieve win-win cooperation.

Wang Yi clarified China's position on bringing China-Canada relations back to a sound and stable track, expressing the hope that Canada could establish a correct understanding of China, take a long-term view of bilateral relations, and provide positive anticipation for practical cooperation; stop hyping up the ""China threat"" theory, stop spreading false information about the so-called ""Chinese interference in Canada's internal affairs"", and stop overstretching the concept of national security regarding exchanges in economy and trade as well as science and technology. The two sides should earnestly respect each other's core interests, and take concrete actions to safeguard the political foundation of bilateral relations.

Joly extended to the Chinese side her greetings for the Chinese New Year of the Dragon, noting that Canada pursues pragmatic diplomacy and is committed to improving its relations with China. Canada is ready to make joint efforts with China to overcome difficulties, build trust, carry out cooperation in climate change, biodiversity, public health and other fields, and strengthen people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Canada will continue to pursue the one-China policy.

The two sides also had an exchange of views on Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza, among others."

120725,Statement for the 9th anniversary of the South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal ruling,"Statement
July 11, 2025 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

Today, Global Affairs Canada issued the following statement:

“Canada reaffirms its unwavering commitment to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific. In 2016, a Permanent Court of Arbitration released its decision on the South China Sea case between China and the Philippines.

“Canada reiterates that this July 12, 2016, decision is legally binding on the parties and provides a foundation for the peaceful resolution of competing maritime claims in the region, consistent with international law.

“China’s coercive and dangerous actions against Philippine and Vietnamese vessels -- including the use of water cannons, dangerous maneuvers, ramming, forcible towing, and the unlawful boarding of vessels -- endanger the safety of seafarers and seriously degrade regional peace and security. Canada continues to call on China to abide by the tribunal’s decision and cease all actions that escalate tensions and threaten maritime safety.

“As outlined in its Indo-Pacific Strategy, Canada is working with ASEAN member states, including the Philippines, to ensure full respect for international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, in the South China Sea. 

“Canada also welcomes ongoing efforts by ASEAN member states to develop an effective and substantive code of conduct for the South China Sea. An agreement on a common way forward is essential to set conditions for effective, responsible, collaborative management of maritime resources, maintenance of maritime safety, and preservation of marine biodiversity.”"

April 22, 2025
Ottawa, Ontario

The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) announced today that it is initiating an investigation to determine whether certain carbon and alloy steel wire originating in or exported from the People's Republic of China, the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, the Republic of India, the Italian Republic, the Federation of Malaysia, the Portuguese Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Republic of Türkiye, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is being sold at unfair prices in Canada. This practice of dumping goods into Canada can harm Canadian industries by undercutting Canadian prices, which undermines fair competition.

The CBSA is investigating because of a complaint filed by Sivaco Wire Group 2004, L.P. and ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada G.P. The complainants allege that as a result of an increase in the volume of the dumped imports, they have suffered material injury in the form of price undercutting, price depression, lost sales, lost market share, reduced net income and profitability, reduction in capacity utilization, inability to raise capital for investments, and reduced employment.

The CBSA and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) both play a role in the investigation. The CITT will begin a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the imports are harming Canadian producers and will issue a decision by June 20, 2025. Concurrently, the CBSA will investigate whether the imports are being sold in Canada at unfair prices, and will make a preliminary decision by July 21, 2025.

Currently, there are 158 special import measures in force in Canada, covering a wide variety of industrial and consumer products. These measures have directly helped to protect approximately 31,000 Canadian jobs and $11.6 billion in Canadian production.

Quick facts
Canada’s trade remedy system is designed to ensure that imported goods are priced fairly relative to domestic products. To counteract unfair trade practices, the CBSA has the authority under the Special Import Measures Act to initiate investigations if a complaint is properly documented and impose trade remedy measures when there is evidence that dumping or subsidizing is causing or threatens to cause injury to Canadian producers.

The subject goods are certain carbon and alloy steel wire originating in or exported from the People's Republic of China, the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, the Republic of India, the Italian Republic, the Federation of Malaysia, the Portuguese Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the Kingdom of Thailand, the Republic of Türkiye, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. For more product information, please refer to the CBSA’s Anti-dumping and countervailing webpage. 

The Canadian producers of certain carbon and alloy steel wire affected by this investigation include Sivaco Wire Group, 2004 L.P. (Marieville, QC) and ArcelorMittal Long Products Canada G.P. (Contrecoeur, QC).

The total Canadian market for certain carbon and alloy steel wire has been estimated to be approximately $463 million annually.

A statement of reasons, with additional details about the investigation, will be available on the CBSA's website within 15 days from the date the investigation is launched."

090325,"Statement by ministers Ng, MacAulay and Lebouthillier on China’s anti-discrimination investigation","Statement

March 8, 2025 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada

The Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development, the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, and the Honourable Diane Lebouthillier, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, today issued the following statement in response to China’s announcement of tariffs against Canadian agricultural, fish and seafood products:

“Today, China announced the conclusion of a domestic ‘anti-discrimination’ investigation that it launched against Canada on September 26, 2024. The investigation resulted in the announcement of unjustified tariffs on Canadian canola oil and meal, peas, fish, seafood and pork products and is scheduled to enter into force on March 20, 2025.

“Canada does not accept the premise of China’s investigation, nor its findings. We are deeply disappointed with China’s announced measures.   

“Our hard-working farmers and fishers provide world-class food to Canadians and international trading partners. Canadian products meet the highest standards, and our inspection systems are robust. As a trading partner, Canada has demonstrated a commitment to ensuring a level playing field for Canadian businesses, and support for fair, rules-based trade. This includes addressing China’s non-market policies and practices that artificially lower production costs and distort markets. Canada remains open to engaging in constructive dialogue with Chinese officials to address our respective trade concerns.

Today, Global Affairs Canada issued the following statement:

“Two years have passed since the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released a landmark assessment, detailing grave human rights violations in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. The assessment describes serious human rights violations that have been committed in Xinjiang, and notes that the extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.

“After the assessment was released, Canada called on the Chinese government to uphold its international human rights obligations and respond to the grave concerns and assessment recommendations.

“Two years later, China has not taken meaningful steps to address these concerns despite ongoing calls from Canada, other governments, UN experts, human rights organizations, victims’ groups and the global Uyghur diaspora. 

“Reports continue to point to systemic human rights violations by Chinese authorities. Uyghurs are forced into labour in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China. Religious practice, particularly Islam, is limited, with mosques being the first to be massively targeted. 

“UN experts have also expressed concerns that children are being forced into state-run residential schools in Xinjiang and other parts of China. Instead of addressing these concerns with transparency, China denied the findings and blocked discussion at the UN Human Rights Council.

“Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Mélanie Joly has raised Canada’s concerns with Wang Yi, China’s Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Canada’s Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China Jennifer May also raised them with local officials during her recent visit to Xinjiang.

“Canada calls on China to address the concerns raised in the UN assessment and to implement its recommendations without delay. This includes allowing UN independent experts access to Xinjiang and to other regions of China to assess conditions.

“Canada will continue to work with its international partners to address the situation in Xinjiang and to ensure the Chinese government is held accountable for its actions.”"

“Canada condemns the dangerous and destabilizing actions taken by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) against Philippine vessels on June 17, 2024, near Second Thomas Shoal.

They also discussed ways to make the CPTPP work for as many people as possible, including those who have been traditionally under-represented, such as women and Indigenous Peoples.

Minister Ng noted that, as the commission’s 2024 chair, Canada is working to ensure that the CPTPP remains at the cutting edge of trade policy to build a brighter future for member economies. She also highlighted Canada’s progress on the General Review of the CPTPP, which aims to address challenges and adapt the agreement to global changes.

Minister Ng reiterated Canada’s commitment to helping women entrepreneurs overcome obstacles and discover opportunities in global markets. She spoke about opportunities to empower women in trade and highlighted the many ways Canadian programs and Global Trade and Gender Arrangement initiatives are helping make international trade more inclusive and sustainable.

Throughout her meetings, Minister Ng condemned Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable war of aggression against Ukraine, which has had significant economic and trade impacts globally, including by exacerbating supply-chain issues, energy and food insecurity, and high inflation.

March 20, 2024 - Ottawa, Canada - Global Affairs Canada

Global Affairs Canada today issued the following statement on Hong Kong’s rapid passage of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and expressing deep concern regarding the impact the new law could have on human rights in Hong Kong:

“Canada is concerned that the new national security law adopted by Hong Kong could deviate further from internationally accepted standards of proportionality, transparency and accountability.

“The law’s broad definitions of national security offences and national security threats raise concerns about the potential for enforcement overreach. There is no clear provision for an independent review mechanism to ensure proportionality, transparency, and accountability in the law’s application.

“Canada recognizes Hong Kong’s right to enact legislation to address legitimate national security considerations. This new legislation, however, fails to safeguard the human rights and freedoms enshrined in the Basic Law and in international instruments to which Hong Kong is a party.

“The National Security Law imposed in 2020 led to the violation of human rights and the suppression of open debate in Hong Kong. The new law risks compounding the chilling effect created by the National Security Law at a moment when the city is trying to maintain its status as an open and free international hub.”"
